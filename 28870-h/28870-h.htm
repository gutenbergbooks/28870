<h2>A FRONTIER PROPHET</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>
<p>&#8220;If you stay here long, you will become so Westernized
that you will lose all love for New England. That&#8217;s my
experience.&#8221; So said a brawny pioneer, a man of large
mind, and generous heart, and a sledge-hammer fist that
never struck a coward&#8217;s blow; but when swung in defence
of the right was like &#8220;the jaw-bone&#8221; of Samson to the
Philistines. He had emigrated from Maine twenty years
before, and was one of the first settlers I met on the prairie
near the scene of my story. Was his prediction fulfilled?
Ah, how like sweetest music sounded the bells of Salem
(city of peace) the first Sunday of my return to the Old
Bay State! Besides, the frontiersman misrepresented himself.
For, seated by his ample clay-stick-and-stone fireplace,
how his eye kindled, and tones mellowed, as he
treated us to reminiscences of his early days! And what
a grip he gave the hand of a freshly-arrived Yankee!</p>
<p>Then there were those east who said, &#8220;You will soon
tire of the West.&#8221; They, also, were mistaken. An invalid,
with shadowy form and trembling limbs, when I left New
England, I awakened to a new life in Minnesota. &#8220;Take
a gun on your shoulders, kill and eat the wild game of
the prairies,&#8221; said my medical friends. I anticipated vicissitude
and deprivation in following such counsel; but these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
toughened my weak frame, and added zest to frontier labors
and pleasures; for I was soon able to do a man&#8217;s share
of the former, and in threading forest and prairie I was
brought into delightful nearness to nature in its beauty,
freshness, and magnitude, and in visiting the lodge of the
Indian and the cabins of the settlers I met with plenty
of adventure.</p>
<p>In writing this work, I have, with peculiar interest, lived
over the scenes and incidents of my varied frontier experience;
have travelled once more amid the waving grasses
and beckoning flowers; heard again the bark of the wolf,
and the voices of birds; felt on my brow the kiss of the
health-giving breeze; worshipped anew in the log-cabin
sanctuary. Yes, East and West are both dear to me. One
fittingly supplements the other. Each holds the ashes of
kindred. By a singular providence, since this tale was
completed, a much-loved relative, one of the gentlest and
most self-sacrificing whose presence ever glorified the earth,
has found a resting-place in the bosom of the very prairie
I had in mind while penning these pages. Sent west by
physicians to save her life, she reached that spot in time
to die, thus attaching my heart to that soil by another and
sorrowful tie.</p>
<p>That East and West may be bound together by love, as
well as by national and commercial relations, and that
this story may tend in its humble way to so happy a result,
is the earnest wish of</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>THE PIONEER FAMILY.&ndash;A SPIRITED CHASE.</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;There, the last hill is dug, and I&#8217;m glad!&#8221;
and Tom Jones leaned on his hoe, lost in
thought.</p>
<p>He was a stout lad of sixteen, with frowzy
brown hair, crowned by a brimless straw hat,
and his pants looked as if they had been turned
inside out and outside in, upside down and downside
up, and darned and patched and re-darned
and patched again, until time, and labor, and
cloth enough, such as it was, had been used to
fabricate a number of pairs of pants. As for
boots,&ndash;for his lower extremities were not wholly
destitute of protection,&ndash;they might have come
down to him as an heir-loom from a pauper of a
preceding generation. But what mattered it to
him that his clothes were threadbare, many-hued,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
and grotesque? or that his boots let the deep,
rich soil in at sides and toes? Was he not a
&#8220;squatter sovereign,&#8221; or the son of one, free in
his habits as the Indian that roamed the prairies
of his frontier home? He had not heard of
&#8220;the latest fashion,&#8221; and paid no attention to the
cut of his garments, although, it must be confessed,
he sometimes wished them a trifle more
spruce and comfortable. His home, as I have
hinted, was on the prairie. Nevertheless, the
family domain was an unpretending one. Less
than an acre, fenced in the rudest manner, enclosed
the &#8220;farm and farm buildings,&#8221; the latter
consisting of a small log house and log pigsty,
the cabin, at the time our sketch opens, being, it
is evident, at least two seasons old&ndash;a fact which
serves to show the more plainly the poverty and
thriftlessness of the inmates; for they have had
time, certainly, to cultivate quite a tract of the
easily-tilled land, had they enterprise and industry.
But they belonged to a class not famous
for these virtues&ndash;the restless, ever-moving class
that pioneer the way towards the setting sun.
But perhaps we are leaving the boy propped too
long on his hoe. Let us take a more critical look
at him. &#8220;Fine feathers don&#8217;t make fine birds,&#8221;
observes the old proverb. Forgetting the dress,
then, please study his face. A clear, deep-blue
eye, delicately-arched eyebrows, regular features,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
mouth and chin indicating decision and native
refinement, and a well-developed forehead. Ah,
here may be a diamond in the rough! Who
knows?</p>
<p>The squatter&#8217;s son looked about him with a
dissatisfied air. &#8220;I do wish,&#8221; he soliloquized,
&#8220;that I could see something of the world, and do
something for myself. Here we&#8217;ve been changing
around from one place to another, doing
nothing but raise a few potatoes and a little corn,
living in a miserable cabin, where there are no
schools, and scarcely any neighbors. It&#8217;s too
bad to spend all our days so. I believe we were
made for something better; and, as the minister
told us Sunday, we ought to try and be somebody,
and not float along as the stick on the
stream. I&#8217;m sure it isn&#8217;t, and never was, to
mother&#8217;s mind; and, as to father&ndash;&#8221; And here
he stopped and pondered, as if trying to solve a
mystery, and in a style that would have been
pronounced philosophic, had he been a college
professor&ndash;scratched his head. Then, with his
ragged sleeve, he wiped the sweat from his brow,
leaving a streak of black that made that part of
his face present quite a different appearance from
what it did, reader, when you and I noticed it a
moment ago. And going to the cabin, he returned
with a rickety basket, and, commencing
at the lower end of the field, began picking up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
the potatoes that had been left drying in the sun.
A goodly crop had the little patch produced; for
the vegetable decays and fertilizing rains and
snows of centuries had covered the prairie with a
dressing with which art could not compete, and
it was more difficult not to get a harvest from the
seed sown than to get one. The rows of hills
were covered with the bountiful returns brought
up to the light of day by Tom&#8217;s well-used hoe.
It was not, however, the size, quality, or number
of the potatoes that most interested Tom just then.
The fact that they were all out of the ground; that
the corn was cut and stacked, and the pumpkins
ready to be housed; that the fall work could be
finished by that afternoon&#8217;s sun-setting,&ndash;stirred
him strangely; for he had of late begun to question
the future, to learn what it had in store for
him. He had come to realize, in a degree, that
that future would be very much what he chose
to make it. And serious dissatisfaction with the
past and the present filled his heart with disquiet.</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s memory had been active for a few days.
How like yesterday it seemed, when he was a
little child, and his father, getting together money
enough, bought a horse and wagon, and, putting
the family in the vehicle, started out prospecting
for a new home farther from the advancing
waves of civilization! How many similar expeditions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
had they taken since, and how painfully
had their experiences illustrated the saying, &#8220;A
rolling stone gathers no moss&#8221;! But roll Mr.
Jones would. Tom knew this too well. It was,
indeed, viewed in one aspect, an easy way to
get on, this going in one&#8217;s own conveyance from
place to place of Uncle Sam&#8217;s unsettled lands;
this living off the country, gypsying in the woods
and on the prairies; this two thirds savage and one
third civilized mode of putting a growing family
through the world; and if you were to see Mr.
Jones seated in the emigrant wagon, reins in
hand and pipe in mouth, or with shouldered rifle
on the track of a deer, you would say that such
a life was eminently agreeable to him. Every
man is made for something; and you would say
that he was cut out for a wandering frontier
loafer, who gets his subsistence by doing the
least possible work in the easiest possible manner,
and hunting and fishing. A horse and wagon,
or extemporized log cabin, for a shelter; tools
enough for the simplest tilling of the soil, and
furniture for the rudest housekeeping and clothing;
the making over, by the industrious wife,
of clothes bought &#8220;some time back,&#8221;&ndash;such was
the way the Joneses lived. Putting up a small
log house by the bank of a river for the sake of
the fish, and near a forest for the game, with
&#8220;a strip of clean prairie&#8221; for &#8220;garden sarce,&#8221;&ndash;there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
they might remain for a year or two; then
you would be quite sure to find the immigrant
friend looking discontented, and expressing a
wish to &#8220;sell his claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s growing so crowded with folks coming
into the country, I can&#8217;t go three miles without
stumbling against a shanty or a house; and cart
tracks are getting so plenty, I can&#8217;t stand it. I
must pull up stakes, and go farther on to find a
place to breathe in.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, perchance, realizing a trifle for his claim
and improvements, Dobbin is hitched anew into
the crazy old wagon. The broken crockery, and
leaky black tea-pot, and ancient cooking-stove&ndash;the
pipe of the latter running up through the
wagon-top&ndash;are once more aboard, wife and children
packed in, and the uneasy frontiersman is
pushing out again towards solitude.</p>
<p>Tom had been reviewing this bit of family history
more in detail, and much more vividly than
we have now done. The result was a feeling
of disgust, and a resolution to break away from
such a life, and an endeavor for something
higher.</p>
<p>But what had brought the squatter&#8217;s son to
such a conclusion? The condition of the family
had for some time been unsatisfactory to Tom.
Though brought up in this roving, improvident
way, his better nature often revolted against it;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
not, however, so strongly and decisively as now.
Still, desires, and even longings, for something
better had flitted through his mind, only to make
him moody and irritable. Doubtless these aspirations
were due, in no small measure, to his
mother&ndash;a woman much superior to her condition,
but who, clinging to her husband with a
pure and changeless love, accepted the privations
of her lot without a murmur. Taken by her
marriage from the comforts and advantages of a
good home, she had followed his fortunes &#8220;for
better or for worse,&#8221; having much more of the
latter, in a worldly point of view, than the former.
Not that Mr. Jones was a hard or a dissipated
man; but his roving habits, and the deprivations
and poverty they endured, had made her days sad
and toil-worn.</p>
<p>Tom, in his tastes, was like his mother. But
a new event had recently occurred. A godly
minister, in search of the lost sheep of the
heavenly fold, had made his way into the region,
and, the Sabbath previous to the opening of our
sketch, had, in earnest, eloquent words, preached
the gospel to the settlers. The log cabin, in
which the services were held, was only a mile
and a half distant, and Tom and his father, with
the neighbors generally, attended. How differently
the gospel message affects different persons!
Some are softened, others are hardened,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
by it. Some are stirred up to certain duties,
while, under the same sermon, others are incited
to an entirely different train of thought and course
of action. The effect on Tom of the sermons
of the preacher was to incite his feelings to revolt
against his lot in life, and arouse him to the necessity
of a purpose in living. He did not look
forward so much to the world to come as to the
&#8220;to come&#8221; of this world. The present in its relations
to life here&ndash;this was the point with him;
and he revolved the subject, viewing it in every
possible light, until a decision was reached.</p>
<p>&#8220;This preacher,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is from a region
of schools and privileges. Why can I not seek
such advantages, and be somebody, and accomplish
something? Why can I not go to the city
to school this winter?&#8221; What an idea for him!
It almost took his breath to think of it. And,
then, how should he get there? Where was the
money coming from to support him while studying?</p>
<p>&#8220;I must work and earn it,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I can
do anything honest; I can, at least, work for my
board.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s mind had suffered from a famine of
knowledge. He could read passably well, write
a little, was good at reckoning, and the little he
knew excited a craving for more. Public addresses
had always moved him deeply, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
living truths of the gospel, as presented by the
living preacher, had set the mental machinery in
motion, until the decision to go from home in
search of an education, had been wrought out;
and it was this rising purpose that kept him so
patiently at his day&#8217;s task of finishing up the
fall work, that he might commence his new
career.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will finish getting in the crops by dark,&#8221;
said he, as he filled the basket, &#8220;and then there
will be nothing to keep me at home;&#8221; and he
was about raising the basket to his shoulder,
when he was startled from his reveries by a loud
cry of,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom, Tom! come quick! I&#8217;ve caught a
fawn, and he&#8217;ll get away!&#8221; It was twelve-year-old
Charley from the hazel bushes that bordered
the potato-patch near the woods. Tom ran to
assist his brother, but could scarcely believe his
eyes when he saw the little fellow had caught
the fawn by the tail, and was struggling to hold
the agile creature, forgetting how dexterously the
deer can use his heels. Scarcely had the elder
brother mounted the fence, when, with a smart
kick, the fawn sent Charley over on his back,
and leaped into the enclosure. At this instant
a bevy of flaxen-haired urchins, hatless, bonnetless,&ndash;Tom&#8217;s
brothers and sisters,&ndash;came whooping
from the cabin, and joined the chase. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
a moment Tom had forgotten all his gloomy
thoughts and high resolves, and was as eager as
any of them, as they tried to secure the nimble
prize. A lively time it was, too; fear and speed
against numbers, noise, and strategy. A good
force were the pursuers; the &#8220;olive plants&#8221; of
the Joneses grew very naturally in regular gradations,
like the steps of a flight of stairs. Tom,
Eliza, Charley, Bob, Sarah, Bill, and Bub, the
four-year-old, were all active with hands, legs,
and lungs, while the mother stood in the doorway,
surveying the scene, with baby in her
arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fix up the fence where the deer jumped
in!&#8221; cried Tom to Charley; and the latter hastened
to repair the breach, for the brush had
been broken down at that point.</p>
<p>From corner to corner and side to side bounded
the deer, slipping through the fingers of one and
another of the youngsters; but they gave him
no rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop him, &#8217;Lize! Hold him, Bob! Head
him off. Say! Get out of the way, Bub!
There! why didn&#8217;t you catch him, Charley?
Mother, can&#8217;t you put down baby, and help us?
He&#8217;ll get away! There! he&#8217;s going over the
fence! No, he isn&#8217;t!&#8221; Amid such vociferations
the children rushed on, pell-mell, till out of
breath. Luckily, the brush fence was so thick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
and high, being made of dead trees piled upon
each other, that the animal could find no point
to push through or scale, especially while kept
in &#8220;running order&#8221; by his pursuers. Although
thus imprisoned, he was baffling their efforts, refusing
to be captured, when Tom said to the
children,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t catch him this way. But if you
will all do as I tell you, I guess we can.&#8221; The
fawn was standing in the further corner of the
field, as if waiting to see what they would do
next. And Tom, ranging his force in line, himself
at the head, gave the word to advance towards
the deer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, steady,&#8221; said he, as they neared the
animal. They had succeeded in approaching
within a few yards, and Tom, with outspread
arms and eagle eye, advanced slowly, watching
to seize him if he should attempt to spring away,
when little Bub, who had been sent into the cabin
by Tom, having gone around unobserved on the
outside of the garden behind the deer, suddenly
ran a sharp stick through the brush into the creature&#8217;s
back, saying,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I make &#8217;im wun!&#8221;</p>
<p>Frantically jumped the deer at this&ndash;a <i>denouement</i>
so unexpected to his assailants, that the line
became broken, the little soldiers were tumbled
together, with Tom on top of them, and the deer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
stood almost at the same instant at the other end
of the patch, the whole being accomplished with
marvellous quickness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get off my head!&#8221; screamed Sarah from
under the heap.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, dear, you&#8217;ll break my arm!&#8221; cried Eliza.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you fall on me for?&#8221; angrily demanded
Bob of Charley, as he spit the dirt from
his mouth. &#8220;You did it on purpose&ndash;you know
you did!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you did!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should a thought Tom might a held the
deer, an&#8217; not fell on us so heavy,&#8221; sobbed Sarah,
rubbing her eyes with her begrimed gown.</p>
<p>But while they fretted, the fawn had been
critically examining the fence to find egress, seeing
which the children dried their tears, and
made for him again; and at length the graceful
creature, bewildered by the din, and foiled by
numbers, was forced to surrender himself after
another vigorous scramble, in which the basket
of potatoes was overturned, and the corn scattered
in delightful disorder, and was borne by Tom in
triumph to the cabin, accompanied by the excited
group.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got him, marm&ndash;we&#8217;ve got him!&#8221;
they shouted in chorus as they followed their
leader into the house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And where will you keep him to-night?&#8221; she
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;He tan seep with me!&#8221; promptly answered
Bub, at which there was much merriment.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Tom, shaking his head at the
mischief-maker, &#8220;you will stick a stick into his
back, and &#8217;make &#8217;im wun&#8217; again.&#8221;</p>
<p>After much deliberation it was decided that the
fawn be tied to a bed-post, while a pen was built
for his accommodation near the cabin. This was
soon accomplished, and the fawn placed in it.</p>
<p>When Tom returned to his work, the day was
far gone. He gazed around with regret as he
saw that not only was it now too late to finish
getting in the crops, but that the chase of the
deer, in which he had engaged with so much
ardor, had made him no little extra labor. What
a task it would be to find all the potatoes, scattered
and trampled into the rich earth as they were!
and the bundles of corn had been broken from
their bindings, and must be gathered together
and refastened. To find and carry in the potatoes
consumed the time till supper; and then, at
his mother&#8217;s call, he went in depressed and unhappy,
and after bringing in the wood for the
breakfast fire, and feeding the pigs, he went up
the rude ladder to his straw bed on the floor.</p>
<p>It was scanty fare that the Jones family had.
You could see that by their looks. It is true that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
they were healthy and strong; but they lacked
the fair, plump development that plenty of food
of a suitable variety gives to childhood and
youth. Of vegetables they were not destitute;
potatoes, corn, beans, and pumpkins they had in
abundance since fall set in, if not before. Bread,
milk, and meat were usually scarce with them.
For the latter they depended principally on the
father&#8217;s rifle; but as he was apt to take wide and
eccentric tramps over the prairies, there would be
long intervals when but little game from his gun
made savory the family cooking.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones had been away for some days now,
and his patient wife had really suffered for food.
Vegetables of the same kind, served up pretty
much in the same way, with little to give relish
to them, a big crying infant the while tugging at
her breast, and the house-work to do, it is not
strange that while the children, fresh from romping
in the bracing prairie air, were favored with
a ravenous appetite, she had little. Tom understood
all this; for, constituted like her, he, too,
felt the deprivations of the table, although in a
less degree, and much did he worry about her
meagre diet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he thought, as he lay down for the
night, &#8220;when I am away and earning, won&#8217;t I
send the good things to mother!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>SHOOTING DOUBLE.&ndash;A FRONTIER DOCTOR.</h3>
</div>
<p>Tom slept soundly, and notwithstanding he
charged his memory to awaken him before daybreak,
dawn was brightening the east while he
was still in the shadowy land of dreams. The
low attic had no window, save a pane of glass
nailed over a hole under the eaves; and long the
lad might have slumbered on, had not a loud
sound suddenly aroused him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it thunder?&#8221; he exclaimed, fearing a
prairie tempest had arisen to interfere with his
cherished project of leaving home.</p>
<p>Peering through the window pane, he saw, to
his surprise, that the morning was cloudless.
What could it mean? Assuredly he had heard
the rolling of thunder! He looked out again, for
another and more agreeable thought had struck
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s the hens!&#8221; he ejaculated; &#8220;my!
what a heap of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>By &#8220;the hens,&#8221; he meant prairie hens; for in
this familiar way they are spoken of at the west.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
They had spied out the corn, and the fact that it
was there, by some telegraphic system in vogue
among the birds, had spread for miles around;
and making their way through the tall grass from
every direction, at once, as the sun appeared,
they flew in a huge body over the little cabin into
the field. For this species of grouse (<i>Tetrao
cupido</i>) are models of good order and punctuality
as to their meals, and many an <i>eastern</i> boy or
girl might, we suspect, get a useful hint from them
on table etiquette. They assemble, as if by appointment,
around the farmer&#8217;s grain-field, and
quietly wait for the breakfast signal, which is the
rising of the sun, then enter the enclosure together,
and having fed just one hour by their
unerring chronometer, they retire, to return at
sunset for another hour&#8217;s feeding. This was their
first visit to Mr. Jones&#8217;s patch; doubtless the trampled
and scattered corn had tempted them in now.</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s eyes danced for joy, as, peeping at the
hens, he hurried on his clothes. Hundreds were
there pecking along like so many turkeys. It
was the combined whirr of their wings that woke
him so effectually; many an older person on the
frontier has been deceived by the same sound,
supposing it to be thunder, so heavy a noise do
these wild fowl of the prairies make when numbers
of them fly together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t mother be glad!&#8221; he whispered to himself;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
&#8220;and what a dinner she&#8217;ll have to-day!&#8221;
And descending the ladder, he took from the
hooked pegs overhead his father&#8217;s old shot-gun,
where it had hung unused for months, and from
a little box some powder and shot, and a percussion
cap; then loading in haste, he rested the
weapon on the window-sill, that he might take
steady aim, and fired at the fowl. A terrible report
followed, and Tom came to himself to find
his mother bathing his forehead, and his sisters
crying. The gun was out of order, and, being
also overloaded, had blown off the lock, burning
his face, and stunning him by the recoil.</p>
<p>Poor Tom returned to consciousness to suffer.
His face began rapidly to swell, and presented a
frightful appearance, so blackened was it by the
powder, and the smarting was intense. Mrs.
Jones, in her isolated life, had been too many times
thrown on her own resources to be wholly overcome
by the disaster. Her chief anxiety was
lest Tom&#8217;s eyes were destroyed, as the eyebrows
and eyelashes had been completely burned off
by the explosion. When she saw, however, that
he was not blind, she said, with tears,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, how glad I am, dear child, that your eyes
are spared!&#8221;</p>
<p>A couple of miles away lived a doctor,&ndash;or an
individual who wore that title,&ndash;on whom, in emergencies,
the scattered settlers were wont to call.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
This queer &AElig;sculapian specimen was remarkably
tall and lank, always went with his pants tucked
in the tops of his thumping cowhide boots, and
wore a red woollen shirt, the soiled and limpsy
neck-band of which, coming nearly to his ears,
served instead of a collar. He dwelt alone, with
his cat, in a rude, claim-shanty, sleeping with his
window open and door unfastened; and if his
services were needed in the night, the messenger
would put his head in at the window and call to
him, or pull the latch-string and walk in. The
doctor was pompous in conversation, and affected
long words; but it was understood&ndash;unfortunately
for his patients&ndash;that his advantages had
been poor.</p>
<p>For this worthy Charley had been promptly
despatched by his mother; and good time did the
child make, so frightened was he about poor Tom.
He was an imaginative lad, and, when much excited,
apt to see &#8220;two hundred black cats fighting
in the yard,&#8221; when there was only a frolicsome
kitten chasing its tail; and at such times he had
the bad habit of running his words together. He
was just the one to send on the errand, so far as
speed was concerned; but when he burst into the
doctor&#8217;s cabin, shouting,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blews-sed-off! blews-sed-off!&#8221; the slumbering
man of herbs prematurely awakened, rubbed
his forehead, to be sure he was not dreaming, and
stammered,&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wha-wha-what&#8217;s to pay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blews-sed-off! blews-sed off!&#8221; reiterated the
urchin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boy,&#8221; said the doctor, now fully aroused, &#8220;be
self-possessed and collected, and state distinctly
what has happened.&#8221; And holding the lad by
the shoulders, he added, &#8220;Speak very slowly,
that I may understand you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blew&ndash;his&ndash;head&ndash;off!&#8221; emphatically repeated
Charley, pausing after each word.</p>
<p>&#8220;A shocking occurrence, truly!&#8221; ejaculated the
physician. &#8220;I do not wonder, boy, that one so
unaccustomed to such sanguinary events should
be terrified. But who is the unfortunate victim
of this tragical and fatal accident&ndash;or was he
murdered in cold blood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Charley, who, in turn, did
not understand the doctor, but supposed he must
assent to all he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;what?&#8221; sharply asked the physician.
&#8220;Was it, I say, an accident, or was the man assassinated?
Be quick, now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesir!&#8221; instantly screamed Charley, thinking
the doctor was now reproving him for speaking
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you <i>are</i> scared out of your seven senses,
you wretched dunce!&#8221; retorted the doctor, out of
temper; and, shaking the lad, he said, &#8220;See if
you can tell me now who it is that&#8217;s killed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our Tom!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how do <i>I</i> know who your Tom is?&#8221;
roared the physician. &#8220;There&#8217;s <i>my</i> Tom;&#8221; and
he pointed to a monstrous gray cat that sat on an
oak chest watching the boy with green-glaring
eyes; &#8220;and if he should mistake you for a thieving
gopher some fine morning, and eat you up
alive, small loss would it be to the world, I&#8217;m
thinking!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s my brother!&#8221; timidly interposed Charley,
keeping to the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your brother! Well, old hunter, what do you
say to that?&#8221; said the doctor, stroking his disagreeable
pet: &#8220;that dirty-faced, uncombed, ill-dressed
ignoramus of a boy claims you for a
relative. Do you realize the honor, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that <i>our</i> Tom is my brother,&#8221; explained
Charley, bursting into tears.</p>
<p>The doctor, softened by his distress, asked
more gently,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;But hasn&#8217;t your Tom any other name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; answered the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is <i>your</i> name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charley what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charley Jones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, I see! you belong to the Jones tribe; not
much matter if all their heads were blown off.
But what do you want of me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mother wants you to come right down quick,
and make Tom well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! after his head&#8217;s blown off? That&#8217;s a
job, anyhow. Nice-looking young man he&#8217;d be&ndash;wouldn&#8217;t
he? going round, well as ever, without
any head on his shoulders. But I see how it
is: his head isn&#8217;t all gone&ndash;just a trifle left&ndash;enough
to grow another with;&#8221; and the doctor,
now in good humor, succeeded in drawing from
the lad an intelligible account of the accident,
and mounting his horse, with saddle-bags behind
him, and a tin pail in his hand, he proceeded to
a well-to-do settler&#8217;s, and narrating the accident
with nearly as much exaggeration as did little
Charley, he added, with an emphatic jerk of his
collar, &#8220;I&#8217;ll fix the fellow up so that he&#8217;ll be as
good as new.&#8221; He then begged some yeast, and
a roll of cotton batting, and, repairing to the
Joneses, covered Tom&#8217;s face with the cotton dipped
in the yeast, and returned to his loggery. Whether
the application was in accordance with the <i>Materia
Medica</i> of orthodox practice or not, after a
short time the pain subsided, and Tom dropped
into a peaceful sleep; seeing which, Mrs. Jones
went about her morning&#8217;s work with a thankful
heart. The children had had nothing to eat as
yet, and now that their brother&#8217;s moanings had
ceased, they realized that they were hungry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tan&#8217;t I have my supper?&#8221; sobbed Bub, clinging
to his mother&#8217;s dress as she walked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t supper; it&#8217;s breakfast!&#8221; answered Bob,
giving the child a push, which helped him cry
the louder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cry-baby cripsy,&#8221; mocked Bob, making ugly
faces at the little fellow; for fasting had made Bob
quarrelsome.</p>
<p>Sad-eyed Mrs. Jones tried in vain to quiet them,
carrying and nursing baby and preparing the
meal at the same time, for even the older children
were cross as unfed cubs. Mrs. Jones was no
disciplinarian; she was too broken-spirited to
command her offspring; if she ruled at all, it was
by affection and tact. In this instance she set
the older ones at work. One she directed to replenish
the fire, another to wash the potatoes, a
third to sweep the floor: a slow job the latter
was, as the &#8220;truncheon,&#8221; or floor of split logs,
was jagged, and the broom worn nearly to the
handle. She suggested to Charley to see if the
fawn had got away, which had the effect of causing
Bub to go on the same mission. This stratagem,
however, did not avail much in the case of
Charley, who quickly saw through his mother&#8217;s
device, and returned, exclaiming,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! I guess the fawn&#8217;s all right!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bub found congenial occupation in teasing
the fawn. The pen was narrow; and Bub, not
being able to reach the deer, and tired of shouting
at him, started off into the field for a famous long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
stick which had served him for a steed the day
before. As he looked for it among the corn, he
saw something flutter, then heard a curious cackle.
It was a prairie hen, whose wings had been broken
by shot from Tom&#8217;s gun. The bird moved painfully
away, trying to hide behind the leafy stalks.
But Bub&#8217;s bright eyes could not be eluded, and
he followed after, calling, &#8220;Chick, chick, chick!&#8221;
mistaking it for a domestic fowl. The cunning
bird dodged in and out among the standing and
prostrate stacks with marvellous swiftness, considering
its condition; but persevering curly-pate
seized the hen at last by the neck, saying, exultantly,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dot yer; now you &#8217;have!&#8221;</p>
<p>The strong wild fowl struggled desperately,
scratching his chubby hand until it bled; but Bub
trudged on with his prize into the cabin, saying,
as he entered,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;See, marm! I totched a biddy!&#8221;</p>
<p>The little captor&#8217;s entrance was greeted with
shouts of delight on the part of the children, and
by a loving kiss from his mother; for Bub was a
great favorite, and a manly wee boy, despite his
loud-lunged blubbering, in which he excelled on
occasions, and his mischievious pranks, in which
also he was the equal of Bubs of more civilized
communities. As he stood in the cabin door,
coolly holding the kicking prairie hen, heedless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
of its cruel claws, his torn and soiled baby-frock
surmounted by a round fat face, bright blue eyes,
and light hair falling in tangled ringlets, the
golden sun resting upon his bare head and lighting
up his dimpled cheek, he formed a picture
worthy the pencil of an artist.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a little man you are!&#8221; exclaimed the
mother, taking the heavy fowl from him. &#8220;You
shall have some nice breakfast for this!&#8221; and she
put a baked potato and a piece of corn-cake on
the corner of a trunk, and while Bub with a satisfied
hum partook of the food, she quietly slipped
out of doors and wrung the hen&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>The children plied the little hero with questions
as to where and how he caught the hen, which
he took his own time to answer while he munched.
Then they rushed out in a body, hoping to find
another. Their search was successful, and
they brought back two, which they found lying
some distance apart, quite dead. The old gun
had &#8220;scattered&#8221; prodigiously, but, as the flock of
hens was so large, did good execution, as appeared
from the result.</p>
<p>Tom was asleep on his mother&#8217;s bed,&ndash;which
occupied a corner of the one room,&ndash;but, aroused
by the din which greeted Bub when he came in
with the &#8220;biddy,&#8221; regarded the affair quite complacently,
although he said nothing. And as the
hens were being picked by &#8217;Lize and Sarah, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
was comforted by the reflection that his well-meant
attempt at gunning had brought the family something
to eat. Tom, indeed, had never seen fowl
prepared for the household under just such circumstances,
and he watched each step in the
process with peculiar interest. Mrs. Jones, with
a fond mother&#8217;s quickness, understood well how
he felt, and, though she seemed not to notice him,
made unusual parade in all that was done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be very careful of those feathers, girls. Why,
how thick and soft they are! We&#8217;ll save every
one; and who knows but when Tom gets well
he&#8217;ll contrive some traps and catch hens enough
to make a pair of pillows, or a feather-bed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is a feather-bed very nice?&#8221; asked Sarah.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very, when the weather is cold, and a body
is weakly, as Tom is now; it&#8217;s so easy to rest
upon. There, Eliza, you may pass me the one
that is picked, and I&#8217;ll dress it. How fat it is!
and so tender! What a feast we shall have!
How thankful we ought to be that Tom&#8217;s eyes
were not put out when he shot these hens! How
good he was to think of getting them for us! I
hope, girls, you&#8217;ll help him all you can, when he
gets about, and not let him do all the chores.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones was very handy at such work, and
she took care to face the bed so that he might see
every part of the operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the heart, and there&#8217;s the liver&ndash;sweet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
as a nut!&#8221; and she smelled of them with
the air of an epicure. &#8220;We must keep them by
themselves for the present.&#8221; Then, deftly jointing
the fowl, she put the parts to soak in cold
water, strongly salted. &#8220;That will take out the
<i>wild</i> taste,&#8221; said she. &#8220;How I do wish Tom
could eat some of this when it is cooked, it will
be so strengthening! But I guess, if nothing
happens, the doctor will let him have a taste to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>WHERE CAN HE BE?&ndash;A HEART REVELATION.</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Where can he be?&#8221; sighed Mrs. Jones, as
she looked anxiously out of the little cabin window.
Many times a day had she done the same,
save that she <i>thought</i> the question, but did not
utter it, as now. Her husband had been away
for more than a week, and no tidings from him.
What could it mean? When would he return?
Had any evil befallen him? These and similar
inquiries were continually arising in her mind,
filling her with disquiet. She was one of those
singularly-constituted persons who are given to
presentiments, and who, when they are under
the spell of a deep, controlling conviction that
something unusual is to transpire,&ndash;a persuasion
that comes to them, not through reason or
evidence, or the probabilities of things, but, as
some express it, &#8220;as if a voice had spoken to
them&#8221; when no human being was near, or by a
secret whispering to the soul by some unseen and
seemingly superhuman authority,&ndash;when she
had such a presentiment it never deceived her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
For some time she had foreboded trouble. The
foreboding grew upon her till its dark shadow
cast a gloom upon all her feelings; it thrilled
her at times with fear. She would start at the
veriest trifles, as if affrighted. Particularly at
night did she cower under the feeling, and of
late it had been hard for her to sleep; and when
she slept, it was wakefully: often would she start
up, and look around to see that all was right,
then fall asleep again. And yet she did not apprehend
danger to herself particularly. Sometimes
she feared for her husband; but the growing
feeling was, that trouble for the settlers was
at hand, and a terrible fear of the Indians rested
upon her.</p>
<p>It was far into the night now, and the lone
watcher felt too uneasy to retire. The moon
shone with great brilliancy, and she sat without
a light, busying herself with some coarse sewing.
The children were peacefully sleeping, and
not a sound was to be heard save their breathing,
and the whisper of the wind outside. The
silence was painful to her, and she arose and
peered out of the window again. Everything
looked weird and ghastly. What a solitude!
For miles over the smooth prairie not a human
habitation was to be seen. In the other direction
stood the mysterious forest. How black and dismal
seemed the trunks of the trees in the shimmering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
moonbeams! She gazed timidly at their
indistinct outlines, with strained eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;How foolish I am!&#8221; she murmured; but, as
she turned from the window, her attention was
fixed once more upon the forest; for it seemed
to her that a dark object moved along its outskirts.
&#8220;It&#8217;s only the trees!&#8221; she said, striving
to reassure herself.</p>
<p>But in a moment more an ox appeared; then a
dark figure followed, and another, and another,
walking in single file. As the strange procession
emerged more fully into view, she saw that
the forms behind the ox were those of Indians;
they were driving off the settlers&#8217; cattle. As
their route lay near the cabin, fear that they
would pay her a visit, for a moment quite paralyzed
her. It was but for a moment, however;
the instinct of the mother was roused. Her children
might be murdered. She glanced again at
the advancing savages, and then, softly opening
the door,&ndash;which, fortunately, was on the other
side of the cabin,&ndash;she returned with the axe,
the only weapon of defence at hand, and, with
flashing eyes, and a deadly resolution depicted
on her face, which seemed turned to marble,
silently awaited the onslaught. But the savages,
in their soft moccasins, glided noiselessly by, like
so many snakes. They did not appear to notice
the cabin, and were soon out of sight. When
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
they were gone, Mrs. Jones sat down, feeling as
weak as before she had felt strong. The reaction
was too great, and, a faintness coming on,
her head sank upon the side of the bed where
Tom lay. This aroused him, and he called, repeatedly,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother! mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; she whispered, at last; &#8220;they&#8217;ll hear
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; whispered Tom, alarmed.</p>
<p>The mother kept perfectly still, listening intently,
until satisfied that the danger was really
past; then she related to her son what she had
seen, and what her fears had been.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mother,&#8221; said Tom, confidently, &#8220;there
are no signs of trouble from them. They
wouldn&#8217;t dare to attack the settlers; for they
have always been beaten by the white man.
Besides, there are not many near us. You see
that these have not harmed us; they only stole
an ox. Why, mother, don&#8217;t you know that there
has been no Indian war for a good many years,
and that the Indians have been growing weaker
and weaker all the time, and going farther and
farther off?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was plausible; and Tom only expressed
the views of the settlers. Mrs. Jones knew that
there was no reason for her anxiety, except her
fears, and she had not ventured to express them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
to any one before; for she was aware, such was
the prevalent feeling on this subject, that it would
expose her to ridicule. But now she only shook
her head, and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish your father was safe at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, mother, you don&#8217;t worry about him&ndash;do
you?&#8221; exclaimed Tom, in amazement. &#8220;The
Indians always liked him, and he can go anywhere
over the prairies and through the woods
without guide or compass, and not get lost. And
he&#8217;s a great marksman, you know: it wouldn&#8217;t
do for an Indian to get in the way of his rifle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Tom,&#8221; said the mother, taking his hand,
and suddenly changing the subject, &#8220;why is it
that you don&#8217;t get better faster? Your skin is
real hot, and you look feverish. The doctor said
you ought to have been out before this.&#8221; Tom
looked down, but did not reply. &#8220;Tom,&#8221; continued
she, tenderly, &#8220;something is troubling your
mind. I have known it for some time. Don&#8217;t
you love your mother well enough to make her
your confidant? What is the matter, my son?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still the lad did not reply; but his heart was
deeply moved by this unexpected and loving attack
upon the citadel that held his secret secure,
as he had supposed. Soon the tears began to
stream from his eyes, and he sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones&#8217;s eyes closed, and her lips moved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
as if she were in prayer; upon which Tom, after
she had ceased, asked, softly,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, are you a Christian?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a serious question, my son,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;I sometimes hope that I am one; but it is a
great thing to be a true follower of the Lord
Jesus Christ. But why do you ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O,&#8221; replied he, embarrassed, &#8220;I don&#8217;t just
know why. I know you&#8217;re <i>good</i> enough to be a
Christian; but you never spoke to us children
about it, and&ndash;I didn&#8217;t know what to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones seemed pained by the answer, and
said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom, I know I have been negligent in this
matter.&#8221; Then she added, hesitatingly, &#8220;But
your father does not feel as I do about it; and I
have scarcely felt like instructing the children contrary
to his views. I have ever tried to please
him in everything; perhaps I have carried this
too far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, were you praying just now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said she, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And were you praying for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my son.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom was silent for a while, and then said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, since I heard the preacher, I have
many times wished I were a Christian; that is,
if&ndash;if&ndash;the Bible is true. But there are some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
things that I don&#8217;t understand, and they are right
in my way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they, Tom?&#8221; He colored, and
said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to tell you, for I am afraid you
will think me very bad. But I thought some
time I would like to ask some one about it who
knows more than I do. You believe that there
is a God, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With all my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that he is pleased with those who do
good, and angry with those who do wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Tom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it seems hard, if this is true, that he
should let me get hurt so the other morning,
as I was trying to shoot the hens for you,
and you needed them so much, when there&#8217;s
Jo Priest, and ever so many more, swearing,
ugly fellows, that go a gunning almost all the
time, and kill things just for the fun of it, and
they get plenty of game, and never get injured;&#8221;
and the lad spoke bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; said the mother, &#8220;there are many
things hard to be understood about God&#8217;s dealings
with us, and I am afraid that a great part
of them seem harder than they really are, because
we are so ignorant. But you know how I
am situated. I don&#8217;t hear any preaching, nor
see those that do, very often; and it&#8217;s not to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
expected that I can clear up these things, as they
can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; interrupted Tom, petulantly, &#8220;that
the preacher was here. I&#8217;d like to ask him; but
perhaps he wouldn&#8217;t like to talk with a poor ignorant
boy like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued the mother, &#8220;I know <i>here</i>&#8221;&ndash;and
she placed her hand upon her heart&ndash;&#8220;that
all God does is just right, however dark it
seems, and that satisfies me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom was impressed by his mother&#8217;s faith, but
soon objected,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, do you think we can always trust
our feelings? You said a little while ago that
you <i>felt</i> that there would be trouble with the Indians;
but nobody expects that. And now you
say that you <i>feel</i> that all God does is right.
Now, if you are wrong about the Indians, and
about father&#8217;s being in danger from them, how
can you be sure that your feelings are right about
God?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; replied she, &#8220;I have a great many
impressions that come to nothing. But there are
<i>some</i> that <i>never</i> do. And I <i>know</i> that God does
right; for I <i>feel</i> that he does; and, Tom, we
shall see about the Indians;&#8221; and she sighed
heavily, and rose, and gazed long and earnestly
off over the prairie, and towards the woods.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
Then, seating herself on the bedside, she said,
gently,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;My son, you haven&#8217;t told me all your troubles
yet. Hadn&#8217;t you better hold nothing back from
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The lad turned away at this, deeply touched
again; &#8220;for,&#8221; thought he, &#8220;her feelings are right
about me; perhaps they are about God;&#8221; and
her persevering and delicate solicitude pierced his
very soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said he, at length, struggling with
emotion, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to grow up ignorant and
useless. And I don&#8217;t want the children and us
all to be so poor and despised;&#8221; and the tears
came again, and the mother&#8217;s mingled with his.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to have it so, and I <i>won&#8217;t</i>,&#8221; he
added, rising in bed, and speaking with excited
energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, my poor child,&#8221; said the mother, &#8220;I knew
it was that that lay on your mind, and took away
your appetite, and made you so unhappy. And
I have been praying for a long while that you
might feel so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t want me to be miserable&ndash;did you,
mother?&#8221; asked Tom, in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;God forbid, Tom. But I couldn&#8217;t wish you
to grow up contented with such a life. I have
felt that you might do a great deal of good in the
world, and I wished you to see it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But, mother, how can I have things different?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; returned she, looking searchingly at him,
&#8220;how have you thought to make them different?&#8221;
The boy averted his face again, and made no
reply for a moment, and then said, softly,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had decided to go away and get learning,
and earn my living, and try to be somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when did you think of starting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The morning,&#8221; answered he, with an unsteady
voice, &#8220;that I got hurt with the gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And were you going off without letting me
know it, Tom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mother; but I expected to write back,
and tell you all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; returned the mother, tenderly, &#8220;you
asked me, a little while ago, why it was that
God let you get hurt that morning when you were
trying to kill the hens for the family, while those
bad boys go uninjured. I believe God&#8217;s ways
were right in this. Why, my dear child, you are
better to me, and more necessary to me, at present,
than many prairie hens; and you might have
harmed yourself more by going from home than
you were by the powder. You meant it well,
Tom; but you reasoned about going away, just
as you reasoned about God&#8217;s dealings with you,
<i>like a child</i>. Tom, you are necessary now to
my comfort, and perhaps my life. I am not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
over strong, and any great trouble might be too
much for me. I am afraid nights now, but I feel
safer when you are here. And you help me a
great deal about house, and in the care of the
children. Your father is away so much I have
to depend on you. And what if, when you are
away, the cabin should take fire,&ndash;and you know
our stove is none of the tightest,&ndash;or if we should
have trouble with the savages? And who would
get the wood up for us during the cold winter that
is coming? God took too good care of us, Tom,
to let you forsake us that morning. Besides,
Tom, you wouldn&#8217;t have succeeded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Tom, faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hadn&#8217;t decent clothes to go in, nor any
recommendations. Your life had been very
different from that you proposed to enter upon,
and you hadn&#8217;t a cent of money to help you on
your way. The chances were, that you would
have suffered, and, instead of helping us, as you
do now, you would have been a source of sorrow,
anxiety, and expense to us. Is it not so?&#8221;
Tom saw that his mother understood the case;
but his heart sank as his air-castle fell, and he
wept anew. &#8220;But do not misunderstand me,
Tom, as you did God&#8217;s dealings with you. What
I say brings to you a great disappointment. It
seems almost cruel in me thus to cut off your
hopes of being something better in the world.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Tom, it does not follow, because you were going
too soon, and God permitted an accident to
stop you, that the time may never come for you
to realize your hopes so far as they are right.
You say you wish to be useful. You <i>are</i> useful
now, very useful. Be contented to help at home
for the present, and God will, I doubt not, open
something better for you in his own good time.&#8221;
And, kissing him, she lay down upon her bed
for a short nap before the day should break.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>A BRUSH WITH INDIANS.&ndash;A BLACK HEART.</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Hello! Let me in, I say. Are you all
dead?&#8221; and a strong hand shook the door.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones rubbed her eyes, for she had overslept
herself; and as the children depended on
her to awaken them in the morning, they were
sleeping too. Hastening to the door, she undid
the fastening, and her husband entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Joseph?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t anybody else, I reckon,&#8221; he gruffly
answered; &#8220;but where shall I put this?&#8221; taking
a quarter of venison from his shoulder, which his
wife hung against the wall on a wooden peg.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve got back, Joseph.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well you might be, for you came near never
seeing me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you haven&#8217;t met with any mishap,&#8221;
said the wife, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to speak of, only a scratch from the
bullet of one of them rascally red-skins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you haven&#8217;t been fighting with the Indians&ndash;have
you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;I&#8217;ve always
treated them well; but after this, if any of &#8217;em get
in my way, I shall pop at &#8217;em before they do at
me; that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did they happen to shoot at you?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said her husband, &#8220;just give me something
to put on my side, for it&#8217;s a grain sore after
my long tramp, and cook us a venison steak, and
I&#8217;ll tell you all about it;&#8221; and Mr. Jones, pulling
open his hunting-shirt, showed an ugly-looking
flesh wound in his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, Joseph, you <i>are</i> hurt,&#8221; said the wife,
as she carefully bandaged it, putting on a simple
salve, which she always kept on hand for family
use. &#8220;You look tired and pale&ndash;bringing home
such a load, and bleeding all the way. Sit down,
and I&#8217;ll get you something to eat directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scarcely had he seated himself, when there
was a cry of pain from Tom, and Bub came
tumbling head first upon the floor; for, having
seen his father, he had scrambled, without ceremony,
across Tom&#8217;s sore face, and receiving a
push from the latter, landed upon his nose.</p>
<p>By this time the rest of the children were
awake, and shouting, &#8220;Dad&#8217;s come home!&#8221; while
Bub bellowed at the top of his lungs, &#8220;My nose
beeds! my nose beeds!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, no, it don&#8217;t,&#8221; replied his mother, soothingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it feels <i>wed</i>, it does!&#8221; he answered,
determined to be pitied.</p>
<p>This remark elicited peals of laughter from his
brothers and sisters, which Bub taking as insults,
he roared the louder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Children,&#8221; cried Mrs. Jones, &#8220;stop laughing
at Bub.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he cut too comical a figure for them to stop
at once, for, as he had used, the night before, one
of Tom&#8217;s old shirts for a night dress, he now found
it difficult to move towards his father, as each
time he stepped the garment would trip his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Children,&#8221; interposed Mr. Jones, &#8220;why don&#8217;t
you hush. Your marm&#8217;s spoken to you a number
of times already.&#8221;</p>
<p>At which Bub added with dignity, as he tried
to balance himself,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I des they&#8217;re <i>blind</i>, they&#8217;re so hard o&#8217; hearin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father,&#8221; said the mother, impressively,
&#8220;has been shot at by the Indians, and came very
near being killed, and you ought to keep more
quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they kill you, daddy?&#8221; asked Bub, who
now stood at his father&#8217;s knee, his blue eyes wide
with wonder; &#8220;tause, if they did, I&#8217;ll stick my big
stick into their backs.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a suppressed tittering at this, for
which the children felt half ashamed, considering
the startling intelligence they had just heard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mother was afraid you&#8217;d have trouble with
the Indians,&#8221; observed Tom, &#8220;and she was so
much worried that she didn&#8217;t sleep last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the Indians haven&#8217;t been doing any
mischief about here&ndash;have they?&#8221; asked his
father.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Tom, &#8220;and I told mother that
there wasn&#8217;t any danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the venison was filling the cabin with its
savory smell, and Mrs. Jones said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry, children, and get washed and dressed
for breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>And going to the basin, which was in its place
on the wash-bench outside the door, with much
discussion as to who should have the first chance,
hands and faces were treated to a hasty bath.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones was about forty-five years of age&ndash;a
short, thick-set man, with dark hair and heavy
beard. He was a man of much natural ability,
and exhibited singular contrasts in character and
speech. The free and easy carriage, and quaint
language of the &#8220;Leather-stocking,&#8221; sat easily
upon him; and yet, at times, he would express
himself in words well chosen, and even elegant.
He hated society, and was despised by the settlers
for his lack of enterprise; and yet, when
circumstances drew him out, they were wonder-struck
at the variety and accuracy of his information.
These inconsistencies made him a mystery;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
and he was looked down upon, and looked up
to, as his neighbors came in contact with one of
the other side of his characteristics. In all, too,
that pertained to the habits of the animals, and
the appearance of the country, no one was so
well posted as he. He was built for physical
endurance, was cool and courageous in danger,
but could not confine himself to regular employment,
bodily or mental.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Tom coming to breakfast?&#8221; inquired
Mr. Jones, as the rest of the children were greedily
helping themselves from the plate of meat.</p>
<p>So the mother related how Tom had been hurt,
and then said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t told us how you received
your injury?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Jones, as he pushed away
his plate, having satisfied his appetite, &#8220;I had
started for the lake, hearing that there was a good
many wild geese and other sorts of game there,
and the prospect was, that we should make a pretty
big thing of it; but the afternoon after we reached
the pond, and was looking about a little, Davis
and I were crossing a prairie, and had come in
sight of a grove, and says I to him, &#8216;You just go
round on the other side of the thicket, and I&#8217;ll go
in on this, and if there&#8217;s any deer in there, one
of us&#8217;ll start them out.&#8217; Well, I&#8217;d got within a
few yards of the trees, when, the first I knew, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
heard the crack of a rifle, and a bullet came singing
through my side. Says I to myself, &#8216;That&#8217;s a
red-skin&#8217;s compliments!&#8217; and making believe that
I was a gorner, I pitched forward and lay still as
a door nail, in the tall grass. I hadn&#8217;t lain there
more &#8217;n a minute, when, sure enough, a red-skin
popped out from behind a tree close by, and made
for me, to take my scalp. I had my revolver
ready, and when he was within a few feet of me,
I just let daylight through him; and as he fell,
not knowing how many more of the scamps might
be about, I dragged myself along to the side of
the lake, where I found Davis waiting for me,&ndash;for
he had seen the whole thing,&ndash;and creeping
around to the other side under the banks, we made
tracks for home. Why under the sun the feller
didn&#8217;t put the bullet through my heart, I can&#8217;t make
out, for I never knew one of &#8217;em to miss, when
he was so near as that, and had a fair aim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones then knew why her heart was so
burdened on his account at the very hour of his
marvellous escape from death.</p>
<p>But their conversation was interrupted by a
settler who called to ask if they had seen anything
of a stray pair of cattle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, neighbor Allen, is that you?&#8221; said Mr.
Jones, going to speak to the caller, who sat upon
his horse before the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Jones, when did you git back? and what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
luck?&#8221; rejoined the horseman in a hearty
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a taste of venison,&#8221; replied Mr. Jones,
&#8220;and had a brush with the Injins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, ha! the red scamps want to smell powder
again&ndash;do they? Well, I&#8217;m ready for them, for
one, and I have seven boys not an inch shorter
than I am, and as good with the rifle as the best,
who would like a sight at the varmints. But if
none of your folks have seen any stray cattle
about the diggins, I must be going. Fact is, I
reckon they&#8217;ve been driv off by some thievish
villain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of cattle were yours?&#8221; inquired
Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>&#8220;One was red, and the other was a brindle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the red one very large, with very wide-spreading
horns?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the ticket,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw such a one last night, going down that
way, by our cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did? Was Brindle follerin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied she, &#8220;but some men were driving
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were Indians!&#8221; cried Tom, excitedly.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Jones fell to scraping the tin pan she
held in one hand, with a case-knife, and drowned
his words, so that they did not hear, while she
motioned to him to be silent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>The caller sat thinking a moment. His hair
was silver-white, but his face was youthful and
ruddy; and his massive, well-knit frame indicated
remarkable physical strength. He was a bold
and athletic man, skilful with the rifle, and a lineal
descendant of the revolutionary hero whose name
he bore, and whose fighting characteristics were
reproduced in him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What time was the ox driv by?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;About twelve, I should think,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were the men afoot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ll have to travel fast to git away
from me! And if I catch &#8217;em&ndash;&#8221; But the remainder
of the sentence was lost in the distance,
for the old man had already touched the trail of the
stolen ox, and, dismounting, examined carefully
the ground, then fiercely shouting, &#8220;Indians!&#8221;
drove on at full speed.</p>
<p>When he had gone, Mr. Jones turned to his
wife, and asked,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you <i>see</i> the men that driv the ox?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why on earth didn&#8217;t you say so, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Husband,&#8221; said Mrs. Jones, &#8220;the trouble will
come soon enough; and I was hoping Mr. Allen
would never find out who took his cattle. If he
shoots one Indian, it will bring hundreds of them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
upon the settlements, and we shall have dreadful
times!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fush!&#8221; returned the husband; &#8220;Allen is good
for a dozen Indians, and there are plenty more
of us to help him. But don&#8217;t you be scared; the
red-skins know us too well to risk a fight. They&#8217;ll
only prowl around and steal a little beef, and
shoot at a fellar unaware, from under kiver&ndash;that&#8217;s
all they&#8217;ll venter on&ndash;you can depend on
that!&#8221; Then he took down his rifle, cleaned
and loaded it, and saying, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll go along
a piece; perhaps Allen&#8217;ll come across the varmints
afore he&#8217;s aware,&#8221; with a quick step he was
soon hidden from view.</p>
<p>The news of the accident that had happened
to Tom, and that Mr. Jones had been shot at by
the Indians, spread rapidly, with many exaggerations;
for the inhabitants of a new country, being
mutually dependent, feel a special personal interest
in whatever befalls each other. Besides, there
are not such distinctions as obtain in the old, settled
portions of the country, and they become well
acquainted with one another&#8217;s affairs. Moreover,
the doctor, as he went his rounds, gave a flaming
account of the injury that his patient at the cabin
had sustained, and painted in glowing colors the
magical effects of his professional services. If
he did not assert in so many words that Tom&#8217;s
head was actually blown from his body, and that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
he replaced it so that it was on better than before,
he gave the impression that something as extraordinary
had been achieved by his medical and
surgical skill. And through the day quite a number
called to satisfy their curiosity, or show their
sympathy. It proved, therefore, quite an occasion
for the Jones children, and they feasted their
eyes and ears to their hearts&#8217; content. As for the
mother, weary of the unwonted interruptions,
and wishing to commune with her own heart,
she willingly bade the last visitor &#8220;good by,&#8221; and,
calling Robert, she directed him to bring in some
wood and make a fire, that she might fry some
cakes for tea. Robert proceeded with alacrity
to do this, the other children helping him in the
task, the prospect of the cakes being the quickening
principle. Robert filled the grate with dry
wood, and, proceeding to light it, the room was
soon dense with smoke. This, however, was no
new experience, as the blackened walls of the
cabin testified. But soon the smoke had measurably
cleared away, and the tea-kettle sent up
volumes of steam, and Mrs. Jones, taking some
meal from her frugal stock, poured boiling water
upon it, and added some salt. Then putting on
the griddle some deer fat, she put the dough in
large iron spoonfuls into the sputtering grease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father will relish these,&#8221; said she to the
children, who stood in solid ranks around the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
stove, watching her with interest. And having
taken off the last cake, she set the heaping plate
in the open oven to keep warm till her husband
came.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess pa&#8217;s coming now,&#8221; said Sarah, who,
anxious to get to eating, had looked out to see if
he was in sight. &#8220;No; it isn&#8217;t he, either; I don&#8217;t
know who it is. How nicely dressed he is!&#8221;</p>
<p>At the latter exclamation the family urchins
rushed in a body through the door, upsetting
Sarah in their eagerness to see the wonder.</p>
<p>A gentlemanly, middled-aged man in black,
with gold spectacles and pleasant countenance,
approached.</p>
<p>Accustomed to the plainly-attired specimens of
humanity that do the hard work of the frontier,
the children, overawed by his appearance, shrank
behind cabin and pigsty, in spite of his kindly
invitations to stay, where they peeped at him in
open-mouthed astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Jones, I presume,&#8221; said he, bowing, as,
abashed, she answered his polite rap on the door-frame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; she replied, wondering how he knew
her name.</p>
<p>Entering, without being asked,&ndash;for Mrs.
Jones was too confused to think of it,&ndash;he
said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that your son had met with an injury,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
and as I was looking up children for the Sabbath
school we are to organize next Sunday, I thought
I would step in and see how he was, and how
many of your little ones could attend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the missionary,&#8221; whispered Tom, as his
mother nervously smoothed the bed-clothes.</p>
<p>The good minister heard the remark, and not
appearing to notice the mother&#8217;s embarrassment,
stepped to Tom&#8217;s side, and in a way that made
both mother and son feel at ease, said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you are not seriously hurt, my lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied Tom, grateful for his thoughtful
kindness. &#8220;My face was burnt pretty badly
by the powder; but it&#8217;s nearly well now, and the
black is coming off nicely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you contrive to get hurt so, at this
season of the year? Boys sometimes get burned
with powder on Independence Day. I once met
with such an accident myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did it happen?&#8221; Tom ventured to inquire,
for he loved dearly to hear a story.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was when I was about fourteen,&#8221; replied
the minister. &#8220;I was a wide-awake little good-for-nothing,
and had for some weeks saved up
my pennies to celebrate the Fourth with. I
bought me a half pound of powder, and a little
iron cannon, on wheels, and, as you may believe,
anticipated a jolly time. I had decided, the night
before, to commence the day with a grand salute;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
and that it might produce the greatest effect, I
crept softly down in my stocking feet, by my
parents&#8217; bed-room into the front hall, before daylight,
and having loaded my little gun to the
muzzle the evening before, I touched it off. It
made a great noise, I assure you&ndash;all the louder,
of course, because it was in the house; then, slipping
on my shoes, I went into the streets, leaving
the old folks to go to sleep again if they could.
My first use of the powder, you see, did no harm
to me, unless it made me careless. When I
got into the street, I found crowds of boys and
men were there before me, making all the noise
they could, firing off crackers, pistols, and guns,
and making the foggy morning air resound with
the music of tin horns and drums. Meeting a
boy with a large horse-pistol, I bought it of him
at a foolishly high price, and banged away with
that till breakfast time. At the eastern extremity
of the city, where I then lived, was a high hill,
called Munjoy, on which the soldiers were to
encamp that day; and after eating a hurried meal,
I went there. Scores of white tents were pitched,
occupied by men who sold all sorts of tempting
eatables, while thousands of men, women, and
children walked about. It was an exciting scene
to me. The hill, indeed, was a glorious spot,
for it overlooked the city on the one side, with its
thousands of buildings and shaded streets, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
on the other the harbor, with its shipping and
wharves, and lovely islands, while the ocean
stretched away as far as the eye could reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw the ocean,&#8221; interrupted Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I will tell you what it resembles. You
have looked for miles and miles over the prairie&ndash;I
mean a <i>rolling</i> prairie, that in gentle swells
of land extends till the sky shuts down upon it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, yes,&#8221; answered Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, imagine that prairie turned to water,
so deep that you could not touch bottom with the
longest line you ever saw,&ndash;the ocean would
look so; only remember that it is always in motion&ndash;ebbing,
and flowing, and roaring, and
dashing against the land and the rocks, its waves
sometimes running very high, topped off with a
white foam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O,&#8221; said Tom, earnestly, &#8220;if I could only
once see it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The minister studied Tom&#8217;s expressive face a
moment, and then said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you may, some day. But I was
going to tell you how I got hurt. I had exploded
all the powder, and was about tired of
the pistol,&ndash;for you know such things don&#8217;t
satisfy a great while, after all,&ndash;when I came
across some boys who were making volcanoes.
Volcanoes, you know, are burning mountains.
They took some powder, wet it, worked it with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
their fingers into miniature hills, then put one end
of a strip of match-paper in the top of each, and
lighted the other end of the paper; this would
burn slowly down into the top of the powder-hill;
that would take fire and send up showers of sparks
for quite a while, as it gradually consumed. This
amusement fascinated me. So, buying a quarter
of a pound of powder, I made a hill like those
I had seen, and lighted the match-paper as I saw
them light theirs; but when it had burnt all
away, the hill did not burn. Thinking, therefore,
I had put too much water in mine, I stooped
down and poured on from the paper some dry
powder. In an instant it ignited from a smouldering
spark, exploding also the contents of the
paper which I held in my hand. My face was
dreadfully burned, and became as black as a
negro&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So did mine,&#8221; said Tom; &#8220;but it is coming
off nicely now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I see,&#8221; returned the minister, laughing;
&#8220;and I dare say you worried almost as much
about the <i>black</i> as you did about the <i>burn</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom feared it would never come off,&#8221; said
the mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s just the way I felt. But I have
found out since that there&#8217;s something worse than
a black face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Tom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A black heart!&#8221; replied the minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;A black heart!&#8221; repeated Tom, in doubt of
his meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my lad. What I mean is a heart blackened
by sin. Ah, if folks worried more about
<i>that</i>, and less about their looks, how much more
sensible it would be!&#8221; Then, after a pause, he
said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is one thing for which we should be
very grateful; and that is, that as there are remedies
for us when we injure the body, and disfigure
it,&ndash;as we did our faces, my son,&ndash;that can heal
the injury, and bring the skin out all fresh and
fair, so there is a great Physician, who can heal
the hurt which sin has done our souls, and cause
them to be pure and white forever. Isn&#8217;t that a
glorious thought?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; whispered Tom, weeping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; ejaculated the mother, with deep emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the minister, &#8220;how many of these
little folks&#8221;&ndash;for most of the children had ventured
in, and stood listening spell-bound to his
recital&ndash;&#8220;will come to Sunday school next
Sunday?&#8221; And getting a promise that as many
of them would be there as possible, he took leave,
saying he hoped to call again soon.</p>
<p>The children&#8217;s hearts were taken captive by
their clerical visitor. And well it might be so,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
for he was their true friend. And it mattered
little to him that their dwelling was rude and
comfortless, their clothing old and worn, and their
manners uncultured. He loved them for his
Master&#8217;s sake, and for their souls&#8217; sake: for this
he had left the elegances of his eastern home,
and come out into the wilderness. He was a true
man, and a true minister of Jesus Christ&ndash;seeking
not a name, wealth, luxury, the favor of the
rich and great, but to bring the straying lambs
and sheep into the fold.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we won&#8217;t wait any longer for your
father,&#8221; said Mrs. Jones, after the children had
got somewhat over the excitement caused by the
missionary&#8217;s call; and putting her hand into the
oven to take from thence the plate of cakes, she
looked in to see why she did not find them, exclaiming,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, where are the cakes? I certainly set
them in here. Who has taken them away?&#8221;</p>
<p>The children gazed at each other in consternation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s some of Bub&#8217;s doings,&#8221; said Eliza;
and noticing for the first time that he was not in
the room, they hastened out to find him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bub, Bub!&#8221; called the mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bub, Bub!&#8221; echoed the children, as they
searched the field over, and looked into every
nook and corner that they could think of. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
there was no answer, and not a trace of him was
to be found, until, at last, Charley called out,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s his stick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He cannot be far off, then,&#8221; said his mother,
although she began to grow uneasy about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;for he rides that stick most
all the time:&#8221; then he suddenly added, &#8220;Ah,
you little rascal! I see you!&#8221; Then turning to
the rest, he whispered, &#8220;Just look here, but don&#8217;t
make any noise!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Mrs. Jones and the children, gathering
softly around the pen, peeping in, saw Bub, comfortably
seated by the fawn, the cakes in his lap,
eating them and feeding the gentle creature. Bub
had teased the fawn the most, and Bub was the
first to tame it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>BROTHER SMITH AND QUARTER STAKES.</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Jones. I suppose we
may call this Indian summer&ndash;may we not?&#8221;
and the missionary&ndash;for it was he&ndash;shook hands
with the hunter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scarcely time for it yet,&#8221; replied the latter.
&#8220;But this is fine weather, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall you be busy to-day? I wish to find a
good quarter section of land on which to put up
a house. I have been thinking that as I have
never pre-empted, and have therefore a right to
do so, I may as well do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hunter laughed scornfully, and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good many folks about here pre-empt more
than once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is illegal,&#8221; replied the minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t stand about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they are obliged to take oath at the Land
Office that they have never availed themselves of
the privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they perjure themselves in doing so.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the clergyman, with a sigh, &#8220;I
can&#8217;t understand how a person can break the laws
and take a false oath for the sake of a little land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor can I,&#8221; replied the hunter, almost fiercely;
&#8220;and I makes no pretensions to <i>piety</i>, either.
I pre-empted once, and afterwards sold out; and
I hev moved about considerable sence; but I have
never cheated government out of a cent yet&ndash;nor
anybody, as to that. I don&#8217;t own nothing
here; this is government land that my cabin sets
on, and if it was put up for sale to-day, by the
proper authorities, I couldn&#8217;t say a word if it was
sold, improvements and all. I have to take my
risk, and I&#8217;m contented to, rather than own the
biggest farm out doors, and get it by lying under
oath. No; they calls Joseph Jones a worthless
dog, and <i>I</i> don&#8217;t say he isn&#8217;t; but let me tell you,
neighbor, that I haven&#8217;t it on my conscience that
I went into the Land Office and lifted up my
right hand, solumly promising to speak the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and
then, when I knows that I have pre-empted once,
or maybe a number of times, swear that I never
hev&ndash;as some of your praying, psalm-singing
folks has!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I understand you to say, Mr. Jones, that
professing Christians living about here have done
this?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s <i>just</i> what I say,&#8221; replied the hunter;
&#8220;and I have as much respect for sich whining
hypercrites as I have for a hissing adder: that&#8217;s
why I never took much to meetin&#8217;s, I suppose.
What I gits, I gits honest&ndash;don&#8217;t I, pet?&#8221; and he
caressed his rifle as if it were a living thing, and
understood what he said. &#8220;I brings home what
the good Lord sends inter the woods an&#8217; over the
prairies fur me. &#8216;The cattle upon a thousand
hills are his&#8217;&ndash;that&#8217;s Scripter, I believe; and it
means, I take it, that the deer, and the elk, and
the bear, and the geese and the hens, belong to
<i>him</i>: nobody ken say, &#8216;<i>I</i> owns them all,&#8217; and
keep them for his own use; and when Billy,
here,&#8221;&ndash;patting his gun,&ndash;&#8220;brings down a fat
buck, we feel <i>honest</i> about it&ndash;don&#8217;t we, Bill?
&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t like standing behind the counter with a
smerk on yer face, as yer cheat in weight an&#8217;
measure, or sell sanded sugar for the genuine.
Many an&#8217; many&#8217;s the time I&#8217;ve known this done,
by them that lives in fine houses, and wears fine
clothes, an&#8217; goes reg&#8217;lar to church; an&#8217; if they
passed Joseph Jones, wouldn&#8217;t deign to speak to
the old hunter. Not that I care about that; I
don&#8217;t deign to speak to them; and if heaven is
for <i>them</i>, I had just as lieves stay a while outside,
for they an&#8217; I could never git along together here,
and we couldn&#8217;t be expected to there. But did
you want anything perticular of me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was told,&#8221; said the missionary, &#8220;that none
of the settlers understood so well about the land,
and where to find the section and quarter section
stakes as you; and I thought, if it wouldn&#8217;t be
taking too much of your time, that perhaps you
would show me around a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; would suit my feelings better,&#8221; said
the hunter. &#8220;Was there any perticular direction
you wish to go to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brother Smith tells me that here is a fine
quarter section still unclaimed;&#8221; and the clergyman
took from his note-book a roughly-sketched
map of the vicinity, purporting to show what was
taken up and what was not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he give you <i>that</i>?&#8221; asked the hunter, as
he ran his eye over the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; as looking up land is new to me, I
was thankful to get some sort of a guide,&#8221; replied
the missionary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see much to be thankful for on that
drawin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, isn&#8217;t that quarter section free?&#8221; inquired
the minister, perplexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; an&#8217; we&#8217;ll go an&#8217; see it. But are yer
goin&#8217; afoot?&#8221;</p>
<p>The missionary replied affirmatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never stand it in the world, to hunt up
land in that way&ndash;too much ground to go over.
Wife,&#8221; he added, putting his head in at the door,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
&#8220;you jist entertain the minister, while I see if I
ken scare up a team fur him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones strode off as if he had a congenial
errand to do, and striking a &#8220;bee line&#8221; across the
prairie, over a river, through a grove, halted
before a cosy cottage that would remind one of
New England. The acres and acres of tilled
land stretched away from the dwelling, enclosed
in the most substantial manner, and sleek cattle,
that fed in the rich pasture, bespoke competency
and enterprise. He stopped not to knock at the
door, but entering, asked of a lady who sat sewing&#8217;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is yer husband about, Mrs. Lincoln?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he&#8217;s in the other room. I&#8217;ll speak to
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in a moment the robust form of the owner
of the farm appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, Jones?&#8221; he said, in an offhand
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, I&#8217;m nicely. I called on an errand fur yer
minister, that you&#8217;ve invited to settle among us.
He wants a spot for a cabin,&ndash;like the rest of
us, I suppose,&ndash;and Smith has told him to look
at the quarter section way over there, a mile and
a half beyond Clark&#8217;s; you know the place. I
jist want to git your team and take him over in a
good, Christian way, and not let him travel his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
legs off, so that he can&#8217;t preach to us sinners next
Sunday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln had been foremost in urging the
missionary to cast in his lot with them, and no
one had made more promises of material aid than
he. He was sincere in this, and was really a
generous man, but exceedingly careless. He
had been told that the minister was going to look
up a claim; but it had never occurred to him, until
now, that the preacher had no other conveyance
than his feet, and that to walk over the prairies
would be a toilsome and time-consuming task.
Slapping his caller on the shoulder, he said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to see you interested, Jones; and to encourage
you, I&#8217;ll harness right up, and you may
take the span.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nimble-footed steeds were soon in the
buggy; and the hunter, having taken the preacher
aboard, was, in good time, pointing out to him
the boundaries of the claim. It was a lovely
spot,&ndash;like many such in Prairiedom,&ndash;and the
hunter took care that it should be seen to advantage.
On a gentle swell of ground was a small
gem of a grove, commanding a view of the rest
of the section. The fall flowers, many-hued
and bright-eyed, nodded gayly in the tall grass;
a natural spring, bursting from the hillock, wound
its way along till lost in the distance; the sun
was pouring down its rays from a sky fleecy-clouded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
and soft. How could the preacher, with
his pure tastes and cultivated love of the beautiful,
help being delighted with the scene?</p>
<p>&#8220;This is delightful!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll build
my cottage right here by the side of this spring,
and my tilled land will always be in view.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hunter had anticipated his decision, and
dryly observed,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be no sich place as yer ought to
hev.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked the minister, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you reckon on keeping a horse?&#8221; asked
the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I couldn&#8217;t afford that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How, then, are you goin&#8217; to git to yer appintments,
an&#8217; to visit the sick an&#8217; the dyin&#8217;, from this
pint? And you&#8217;ll never farm it much; the land
looks nice and slick as a gentleman&#8217;s lawn:
this is one of the Lord&#8217;s lawns, neighbor; but
&#8217;twasn&#8217;t made for you to live on. Don&#8217;t you expect
to hev no evenin&#8217; meetin&#8217;s? You can&#8217;t hev
them out here where there&#8217;s no live critter but the
prairie hins, and maybe in the winter a stray
wolf or two. You&#8217;re a <i>perfessional</i> man, and it&#8217;s
necessary for you to be right among folks, and
not livin&#8217; off one side, like as if you wanted to
keep out the way of company.&#8221;</p>
<p>This rugged, common-sense way of putting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
things was quite effective, and the missionary
said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right. But what can I do? By this
chart I find that there is little vacant land about
here, and I am unable to purchase an improved
farm at the prices at which they are held.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to settle down on <i>this</i>&ndash;do
ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is out of the question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Joseph Jones isn&#8217;t of much account, but
if he don&#8217;t show you a bit of land that&#8217;s been left
for jist sich as you, then I lie like that lying
chart,&#8221; he said, angrily. And motioning the
preacher to resume his seat in the buggy, the
hunter drove back for some distance in the direction
from which they had come, then, striking a
well-worn cart-path to the right, suddenly emerged
from a piece of woods near a river, on the farther
bank of which was a saw-mill, and in the stream
were men at work strengthening a dam.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said the hunter, &#8220;is the centre of
things, so fur as this vicinity is concerned. That&#8217;s
the store,&#8221;&ndash;as he pointed across the river to a
small building,&ndash;&#8220;and a hotel is going up just
opposite; and the land sharks and speculators
that&#8217;s going to settle here will want jist sich as
you right among &#8217;em, to stir up their consciences,
and jog their pure minds by way of remembrance,&ndash;as
the Book says,&ndash;an&#8217; not way off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
there!&#8221; pointing contemptuously over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;But brother Smith informs me that all the land
near to the town is taken up,&#8221; said the missionary.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Brother</i> Smith&ndash;who&#8217;s he? I know <i>Charles</i>
Smith; and if you kin fellowship him, I can&#8217;t.
An&#8217; when you come to sift folks down,&ndash;as I
foresee sich as you will,&ndash;you won&#8217;t brother him
much, unless he repints&ndash;an&#8217; I don&#8217;t say he
won&#8217;t. Now let me introduce you to your future
home, ef you settles in these parts. There, <i>this</i>
is the town, where we now are;&#8221; and he placed
the tip of his little finger on the place as represented
on the map. &#8220;Now coming down square
on to the town-site is this eighty-acre lot; lays
beautiful to the town, the main street running
right up to it. And through that street,&#8221; continued
he, impressively, &#8220;must go all the travel to the
important places beyond. And by and by,
when the immigration gets strong enough, the
owner of that piece of land will hev corner lots
and sich to sell. Let me show jist how it lays;&#8221;
and crossing the bridge, and passing up the projected
street, he stopped the horses on a gentle
rise of ground, forming the nearest point in the
eighty acres. &#8220;There,&#8221; he continued, referring
to the map again, &#8220;you see the eighty-acre lot
runs lengthwise from the town. Across it runs
a tributary of the river&ndash;just down there where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
you see the plum and bass-wood trees; and beyond
that are ten acres of the richest and easiest-worked
river bottom that the sun ever shone on&ndash;all
fenced; then follers thirty acres of young
and valuable timber land. Here&#8217;s your building
spot right here where we stand, in sight of everybody,
and all the travel, handy to the store, and
saw-mill, and post-office, and sich, and handy to
meetin&#8217;; and the ten acres of alluvial, rich as the
richest, and finely pulverized as powder,&ndash;you
ken plough it or hoe it jist as easy as you ken turn
your hand over,&ndash;will give you all the sarce you
want, and something to sell. And there&#8217;s wood
enough down over the place to keep yer fires
a going; and when you want to pre-empt, jist sell
some of yer standing timber there, to help pay
for the whole, at government price.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; replied the missionary, as the squatter
finished his graphic description, &#8220;I see by this
chart that this is taken up;&#8221; for he had meanwhile
been examining it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the hunter, &#8220;whose name&#8217;s writ
down as the owner of this land?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry Simonds,&#8221; said the minister, reading
from the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you know who &#8216;Henry Simonds&#8217; may
be?&#8221; asked the hunter. &#8220;It&#8217;s a young chap jist
turned nineteen, and of course not old &#8217;nough to
pre-empt, according to law, and who hasn&#8217;t lived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
on this claim a day in his life. There isn&#8217;t a
sign of a shanty on the place, and the law requires
that every man must show <i>something</i> of a
house to prove that he is an actual settler. That
name&#8217;s a blind. This land jines Smith&#8217;s, and he&#8217;s
been carrying on the ten-acre lot over the river,
rent free; and it comes very handy for him to
come in on this piece and get his saw-logs. It&#8217;s
government property; and all you have to do is,
to put you up a cabin, and go ahead, and if
Smith kicks up a fuss, jist send him to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>This revelation of duplicity on the part of Mr.
Smith took the minister by surprise. It was evident
that the location would be as advantageous
for him as his plain-spoken guide had represented.
It was defrauding the government for
Smith to hold it as he did; and should he, in a
legal way, take possession, no one could accuse
him of wrong. But he had not come out on the
frontier to promote his worldly interests; and he
said to the hunter,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you say is all right, I have no doubt,
Mr. Jones; but it is not land that I want so much
as to do good among this people; and I should
not wish to do anything that would cause ill
feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as I expected,&#8221; said the squatter, with a
disappointed air; &#8220;and I rather think you belong
to the kingdom that is not of this world.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
But you are stopping at Edmunds&#8217;s&ndash;aren&#8217;t you?
Well, it&#8217;s only a short piece to his cabin, and I
must take the team back; but&#8221;&ndash;after thinking a
moment&ndash;&#8220;if you&#8217;ll take the dam on your way,
you&#8217;ll find Palmer there. He&#8217;s a Christian, if
there is one in these parts; and you can depend
on him; and if you choose to talk with him a
bit about this eighty-acre lot, there won&#8217;t be any
harm done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The minister thanked the squatter for his services,
the latter saying, as he drove off,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call on me agin, if you want anything in
my line.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the missionary passed towards the dam,
he saw the surveyors at work, dividing the town
site into lots; and he paused to notice again the
location. The underbrush had been carefully
removed, and the cleared space&ndash;bounded on
one hand by the river, and on the other by the
forest, while farther away from each side stretched
the smooth prairie&ndash;looked as if nature had intended
it as a business centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you like our town plot?&#8221; said a voice
at his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is charming!&#8221; exclaimed the preacher;
and, turning, he saw Mr. Palmer.</p>
<p>He was a medium-sized man, in shirt sleeves
and blue overalls, with an old black silk hat
on, which, from its bent appearance, gave one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
the idea that it had on occasions been used for a
seat as well as a covering. The keen blue eyes
under it, and the general contour of the face,
ending in a smoothly-shaven chin, revealed a
hard-working, frugal, money-saving character,
yet honest, sincere, and unselfish. He was, indeed,&ndash;what
he struck the observer as being,&ndash;a
prudent counsellor, a true friend, a wisely-generous
helper in every good word and work. No
man in the settlement was more respected than
he&ndash;a respect not based on his personal appearance,
it was clear; for he had a perfect contempt
for the ostentations of dress and equipage, but
due to his straightforward and consistent deportment.
He was about forty, and unmarried, and,
on account of his amiable, thrifty, and Christianly
qualities, was said to be the victim of incessant
&#8220;cap-setting&#8221; by managing mammas and marriageable
daughters, and of no little raillery on
the part of the men, which he bore with great
good nature, safely escaping from each matrimonial
snare, and returning joke for joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Been looking up land?&#8221; asked the bachelor.</p>
<p>The missionary related the day&#8217;s doings, and
what the squatter had said about Mr. Smith and
the eighty acres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jones has stated the facts in the case,&#8221; said
Mr. Palmer, &#8220;and advised well; but it won&#8217;t do
for you to have any falling out with Smith. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
you will leave the matter with me, I guess I can
manage it so that you shall have the eighty acres,
and there be no bad feelings. We had better
pay Smith something than to have a quarrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But is Smith a member of a church?&#8221; asked
the missionary.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know who is who, yet,&#8221; answered
the other; &#8220;but should we ever form a church
here, of course he&#8217;ll have to show a certificate of
membership in order to join; and I rather think
he&#8217;ll never be able to do that. Do him all the
good you can, but don&#8217;t trust him overmuch.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>MRS. JONES&#8217;S STORY.&ndash;THE GRAY WOLF.</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Was it so <i>very</i> different east, mother,&#8221;
asked Tom, one day, &#8220;where you came from,
from what it is here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Different in what respects?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;O,&#8221; he answered, hesitatingly, &#8220;I mean, were
folks as poor and ignorant as&ndash;as&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As we are, you were going to say,&#8221; said she,
placidly, finishing his sentence for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that you and father are <i>ignorant</i>,&#8221;
he replied, looking confused; &#8220;but&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand what you mean, Tom. No;
where your father and I were born, and where
we were married, the country was thickly settled.
All the children went to school, and there were
no such cabins as the one we live in, but nice,
framed houses of wood, stone, or brick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were there no poor people there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, as many as there are here,&ndash;a great
many in the large cities,&ndash;and they found it very
hard getting along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were yours and father&#8217;s folks very poor?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No; they were in comfortable circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why, mother, did you come west, and
why do we live as we do now?&#8221;</p>
<p>As she did not at once reply, the lad, busy
once more with his own thoughts, forgot that he
had asked the question. He had often revolved
the matter in his own mind, but had never before
ventured to speak of it. His mother&#8217;s conversation
with him, after his injury by the gun, had
shown him the folly of his plan of leaving home
clandestinely; but dissatisfaction with his lot
grew with his growth and strengthened with his
strength. It was a great mystery to him how
his mother could consent to live so, for so many
years. He would look at the black and crazy
loggery, with its clay &#8220;chinking,&#8221; that was
ever more cracking, and crumbling, and falling
to the floor, leaving holes between the logs,
through which the wind and rain entered; and
the one rickety chair, and the rude benches and
boxes for sitting accommodations, and the bedsteads,
composed of rough oaken slabs, spiked at
the head and side to the walls, and a rough
post at the unsupported corner, and the cracked
and rusted stove and leaky funnel; and then he
would look at his mother, who, despite her coarse
and dingy dress, seemed so superior to her condition;
and the more he realized the contrast, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
more he marvelled. When he was younger, he
had noticed this incongruity between his gentle
mother and her wretched surroundings; and now
he sometimes wished he could be insensible to
it, it made him so unhappy. How restless he
became&ndash;how like a caged eaglet, as he pondered
the subject by night and by day&ndash;none
knew save the watchful friend who moved so
gently about the dark-lighted cabin, and kept so
uncomplainingly at her tasks.</p>
<p>And his father seemed to him, in his way, as
much of a mystery as his mother. Was he contented
with the roving life he led? and did he
never realize the deprivations of his wife and children?
Did father and mother ever know brighter
days? and were they never to see them again?
And was it duty for him to keep on in the same
way, sacrificing every rising aspiration and pure
taste, and getting nothing in return but poor food
and clothing, a comfortless home, and a mind
undeveloped and unfurnished?</p>
<p>Seated on the end of a box, shelling corn by
drawing the ears against the back of a broken
scythe, he had been working and thinking
through the evening, while the children slept,
with no one to notice his absent-minded labor but
his ever-wakeful mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not endure it,&#8221; he mentally exclaimed;
and, by way of emphasis, he drew the ear of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
corn he held against the edge of the scythe with
unusual force, at the same instant springing to
his feet with a cry of pain, and a finger in his
mouth, upsetting his seat, and sending the contents
of the box rolling across the floor, and into
the gaping cracks.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, I&#8217;ve scraped my finger awfully!&#8221; he said,
with grimaces that added nothing to his personal
attractions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, how did you do it, my son?&#8221; asked the
mother, although she knew very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you see, I was thinking about something,
and pulled my finger, instead of the cob,
against the edge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones laid back the strip of bleeding
flesh into the place from which it had thus unceremoniously
been torn, and from which it hung
by a bit of skin, and carefully bound up the
wound.</p>
<p>Then, sweeping the scattered kernels into a
heap, and restoring them to the box, she seated
herself in a little dislocated chair, and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, don&#8217;t shell any more now, Tom;
I have something to say to you. You asked
why we came west. The time has come when
you had better know something of our history;
it may help you decide your course of
action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father and I were born in Connecticut,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
in the same town. We attended school together
in our early childhood, and often played together.
Both of our families were respectable&ndash;your
father&#8217;s quite so, although not so well off as to
property as mine. He was a bright, promising
boy, quick to learn, warm-hearted, and conscientious.
I never knew him guilty of any of the
petty meannesses too common among school
children. He was sensitive to a fault, but had
high notions of honor, and despised falsehood
and deception in any form. When I was seventeen
I became secretly engaged to him. My
parents did not suspect this, nor did any of the
household, except a younger sister, to whom I
confided my secret. I now think it would have
been better for all concerned had I from the first
been open in the matter, and frankly stated to my
mother what my preference was. But I knew
that he was not their choice for me. They were
ambitious to have me marry brilliantly, as the
phrase went,&ndash;that is, wealthily and in style,&ndash;and
he was young, and had his fortune to carve
out pretty much for himself. He knew what their
hopes were concerning me, matrimonially, and,
that I might be perfectly free to break the engagement,
should I repent of it, rarely saw me,
nor did any correspondence pass between us.
My regard for him did not lessen on this account,
for I understood his motives. When he was of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
age, his father died, leaving him a thousand dollars
as his portion. With this he went into business,
with good prospects, in a neighboring city.
I shall never forget how earnestly he spoke,
one evening, as we parted after a brief interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mary,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I will be rich. I&#8217;ve set my
mind on that; and then your father won&#8217;t be
ashamed to own me as a son-in-law, and I shall
come and claim you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed noble and heroic for him to speak
thus; but my heart smote me with foreboding,
and I answered,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But what if you do not succeed?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I <i>will</i> succeed;&#8217; he replied, impetuously.
&#8216;What a man <i>wills</i> he can do.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, how foolish and sinful it is to worship
money and show, as my parents did; how much
suffering it has caused me! and how equally unwise
and presumptuous it was for a young man,
stung by the pride of others, to make that the
rule of his life, and go forth in his own strength
to build up a fortune, so that he might <i>demand</i>
me of my parents as an equal, and thus gratify
his own pride! I see it now, but not clearly
then.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joseph, for a time, was prosperous. Everything
he turned his hand to was remunerative;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
and when we met, his manner was confident and
hopeful.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let the old gentleman look down upon me
now if he chooses,&#8217; he would say; &#8216;he won&#8217;t
always do it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had been a year in business when a
partnership was proposed to him by a man of
education and gentlemanly appearance. Joseph
spoke to me about it, and I said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are doing well enough now. Why not
be contented to go alone? I have often heard
that partnerships are poor ships to sail in.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; said he, &#8216;there&#8217;s something in his appearance
that I do not quite like, and I think I
shall not take him in.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But as the man came with the highest testimonials
as to his character, ability, and influence,
with the hope of greatly enlarging his business,
a copartnership was entered into. Mr. Jacques,
the partner, was Joseph&#8217;s senior in age&ndash;a stout,
robust man, with a high forehead, light hair, always
carried a cane, was jovial, and good-natured
in the extreme, fond of telling a good
story, but sharp in trade. I met him on one occasion,
and there was something in the turn of his
eye&ndash;a restless, jerking, selfish expression&ndash;that
made me shrink from him. Joseph was proud
of his acquisition, and, remembering my caution,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
asked me what I thought of him. I well
remember the reply that leaped to my lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Didn&#8217;t you say that he was religious?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He professes to be,&#8217; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I fear that it is only a cloak to his real character.
If he is a Christian, I do not know what
grace has done for him; but if I do not misread
his face, he is constitutionally dishonest.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But every thing went on smoothly, and Joseph
would say to me when we met,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;My partner loves scandal a little too well&ndash;is
apt to talk against others; but one thing I&#8217;m
sure of&ndash;he&#8217;s honest.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;One morning, some months after this conversation,
I chanced to meet Joseph as he was
going to the office; he looked pale and careworn.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;O,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I have had the most singular
exercise of mind. Some folks are troubled with
sleeplessness; but I never was until last night.
I went to bed feeling as well as usual, but could
not sleep. I was not unusually tired, had taken
a light supper, and saw no reason why I should
be so wakeful. I turned and tossed in bed, and
shut my eyes; but all in vain. I even laid my
finger on my wrist, that the counting of my pulse
might, by the monotony, induce slumber; when,
suddenly, before my mind&#8217;s eye stood my partner;
it seemed as real as life; and with the appearance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
came little remarks of his, little acts and
words, which, as they ranged themselves along
like the links in a chain, revealed him to me,
against my will, as a deceiver and a dishonest
man.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was much excited, and hurried to town.
Mr. Jacques, as I afterwards learned, was there
before him, and met him with his bland smile
and well-turned compliments; and, strange as it
may seem, scarcely an hour had passed before he
had charmed away every shadow of suspicion.
Matters now went on as before for a few weeks,
when Joseph had another sleepless night, and a
more convincing unfolding of his partner&#8217;s real
character; and the next night, after the office had
been closed, he spent in examining the books
of the concern, and detected a number of artfully-contrived
fraudulent entries in the handwriting
of his partner, for, according to agreement, the
latter kept the accounts. Further revelations
showed that he had been gradually abstracting
the stock. As soon as Mr. Jacques saw that he
was being found out, his gentleness and politeness
were all gone, and he raged like a beast of
prey. Joseph attached his furniture at his dwelling,
but found it had all been made over to his
son&ndash;a young lawyer in the city; meanwhile
the dishonest man had fled with his ill-gotten
gains, leaving the business in a frightfully complicated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
state. The result was, as is often the
case when a man begins to go down in his
affairs, although he may be ever so deserving
and innocent, there are enough to give him a
push. It was so with him. In vain did Joseph,
by his books, show that he was doing well up to
the cruel embezzlements, and that if he was dealt
leniently with, he could recover his standing,
and go on as prosperously as before; his creditors,
one after another, ferociously pounced upon
him; he got through one trouble only to meet
another, until utter failure came. The effect on
Joseph was lamentable in the extreme. He sat
by his fire at home, day after day, for weeks,
with his head buried in his hands, in utter despair.
Had some kind friend stepped forward
and started him anew, what a deed of mercy it
would have been! But the men whom he accommodated
with money, when prosperous, turned
their backs upon him now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recovering somewhat from the shock, he
sought again and again for employment; but
his short-sighted and relentless creditors would
factorize his earnings, and thus oblige him to
leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Factorize!&#8221; asked Tom, interrupting her;
&#8220;what is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the mother, &#8220;if a man owes another,
the creditor attaches his wages, and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
the man presents his bill to his employer, he finds
that he cannot pay him anything. In vain he
went to distant places to earn a subsistence.
Shrewd lawyers were put upon his track; he
was ferretted out, until, discouraged, he came to
me one day, and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mary, the hounds are after me from morning
till night. They dog my steps wherever I go,
and give me no chance to retrieve my fortunes.
I am going to the west; and it isn&#8217;t right to hold
you to your engagement any longer, for I can
never, on my part, fulfil it. The odds are
against me here, and, what is worse, I&#8217;ve lost
my courage and hope; I have come to bid you
good by.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;If you do not care for me any longer,&#8217; I said,
&#8216;say so. You&#8217;ve struggled hard, and have merited
a better result; it isn&#8217;t your fault that you
have failed. God forbid that I should break my
promise. If you must go west, you are not going
alone. I shall go with you, and shall this
very night tell my parents all about my engagement,
and get their consent to our marriage.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He shook his head. But feeling that it had
been cowardly in me not to have mentioned the
subject before, whatever the result might have
been, in a few words I frankly, and with a composure
that surprised myself, told them the whole
story. My father was a quick-tempered, imperious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
man, and my mother lived only for this world:
the result you can easily imagine. But I felt that
my duty was plain; and we were quietly married.
Having a little money of my own, joining
it with what your father had by him, we started
towards the setting sun. But what was that?&#8221;
said Mrs. Jones, stopping in her recital, as a
strange sound fell upon her ear.</p>
<p>It was a long, fiendish yell, swelling upon the
still night air over the unbroken solitudes of the
prairie; it was most appalling. Tom and his
mother hastened to the window; they saw a noble
buck, his antlers held aloft, flying with his
utmost speed, pursued by two dark-looking objects,
that gained rapidly on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the gray wolf,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;chasing a
deer. How I wish I had a rifle! I could bring
one of them down easy as not,&#8221;&ndash;as they dashed
by, with short, quick yells, following their prey
into the woods that skirted the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the poor creature will escape,&#8221; said
Mrs. Jones, with a sigh; and she resumed her
narrative. &#8220;I was not long in seeing, on our
journey out, that a dreadful change had been
wrought in your father by his business troubles.
It had given him an unconquerable disgust of
society, which he has not yet outgrown, making
him uneasy and restless wherever he has been;
and this, Tom, is the secret of his wandering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
life; and this is why I never feel that I can complain
at any of the changes in our hard, unsettled
career as a family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom, who had listened absorbed to this before
unread chapter in the family history, was
deeply moved, and, while the tears filled his eyes,
asked, in tremulous tones,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think father&#8217;ll ever get over it,
mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; replied she, &#8220;your father has a true
heart and a good mind, and I believe that, in
some way, good will yet come out of this long-continued
trial. He&#8217;s taken a great liking to the
missionary; and Mr. Payson seems to understand
him better than most, and I am praying
that the acquaintance may lead to something
brighter for him; and, Tom,&#8221; she added, &#8220;I have
told you this that you may see a new reason for
not being in haste to leave your father and
mother. There is one passage in the Bible I
often think of, which directs us to both hope and
quietly wait for the salvation of God. Your
father&#8217;s mistake, when he went into business,
was, that he was in too great haste to accomplish
his own will. This is apt to be the error of the
young. They are sanguine of success, and they
rush into the battle of life without waiting to put
on the armor of faith. What the young want in
setting out, Tom, is a Guide and a Helper, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
cannot err, and will not forsake them. An old
man in our town used to say, &#8216;Never try to kick
open the door of Providence.&#8217; I want you,
Tom, to wait patiently till Providence opens
the door for you. Then you need not be afraid
to go forward.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>A SABBATH ON THE PRAIRIE.</h3>
</div>
<p><i>Extracts from the Missionary&#8217;s Diary.</i></p>
<p>Yesterday I preached my first sermon in a
log cabin. When I awoke in the early morning,
and looked out of the little window at the head
of my bed in the rough, low-roofed attic, a new
world seemed to break on my sight. Instead of
the narrow, noisy streets and tenanted blocks of
the populous eastern city, my eyes rested on
one vast green field stretching to the arching
horizon, over which brooded a profound silence,
intensified by the sacred hush of the Sabbath.</p>
<p>My host offered his own cabin for the forenoon
service. His son&ndash;a sturdy young man of
eighteen, inured to pioneer life&ndash;had ridden far
and wide to give notice of the meeting, and he
was confident of a good attendance. I anticipated
the labors of the day with some misgivings,
for I had become slavishly accustomed to
the use of written sermons; but here, before a
log-cabin audience, to speak from manuscript
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
was not to be thought of. For once, at least, I
must trust to the grace of Christ, and speak as
the Spirit gave utterance. My study was a corner
of the loft, my library a pocket Bible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do all these people come from?&#8221; I
ejaculated in pleased surprise, as, for a full hour
before the time appointed, men, women, and
children, afoot, in wagons and ox-teams, continued
to arrive. And through the cracks in the
loosely-laid, unnailed floor, I could see members
of the family engaged in contriving sitting accommodations
for the growing congregation.
Unplaned oaken boards, placed across trunks,
boxes, and huge blocks, soon filled the room,
every seat being occupied, while groups of men
stood about the door outside, or sat upon the
embankment. I would have a &#8220;full house&#8221; certainly.
And what effort had been made by these
frontier folk to attend I could easily imagine.
Some had walked many miles for the purpose;
most had come quite a distance. And the earnest,
thoughtful faces that met my gaze, as I
descended the ladder, and read the opening
hymn,&ndash;how reverently their heads were bowed
for prayer, and with what hushed interest they
listened to the discourse,&ndash;I can not soon forget.
One woman, who sat surrounded by her family,
wept from the announcement of the text till the
close of the sermon&ndash;wept for joy that, once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
more, after long deprivation of sanctuary privileges,
she could hear the word of God. It was
a scene for a painter&ndash;that log cabin crowded
with representatives of every state in the Union,
in every variety of garb, and of all ages, from
the gray-haired backwoodsman to the babe in
its mother&#8217;s arms. No costly organ was here,
with its gentle, quiet breathings, or grand and
massive harmonies; no trained choir; no consecrated
temple, with its Sabbath bell, and spire
pointing heavenward; no carpeted aisles and
&#8220;dim religious light,&#8221; and sculptured, cushioned
pulpit. But I could not doubt the presence of
the Spirit. And when, at the close, &#8220;Praise
God, from whom all blessings flow,&#8221; was sung to
Old Hundred,&ndash;sung as if with one voice and
soul, the clear, sweet tones of childhood blending
with the deeper sounds of manhood and
womanhood,&ndash;the rough, rude building seemed
as the gate of heaven.</p>
<p>My appointment for the afternoon was at a
small settlement eleven miles away.</p>
<p>A charming drive through the &#8220;oak openings&#8221;
and over the rolling prairie brought us to the
cabin which was to serve as meeting-house. It
was a long, low, one-roomed building, the logs
of which it was constructed still rejoicing in their
primitive covering of bark, the openings between
them being closed with clay thrown in by hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
Mr. G., the owner,&ndash;a short, gray-haired, brisk
little man with a wooden leg, gave me a cordial
welcome, and, to show how willing he was to
have the meeting in his cabin, pointed to his shoemaker&#8217;s
bench, and various articles of furniture,
including a bedstead, trundle-bed, and bedding,
which had been removed from the room, and
piled in admirable disorder outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been to a great deal of trouble,&#8221; I
remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;None too much,&#8221; he cheerily replied. &#8220;I am
an old soldier, you see, and that&#8217;s why I have to
hobble about on this,&#8221; pointing to the ancient artificial
limb. &#8220;I was in the war of 1812, belonged
to the cavalry, and at the battle of&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Husband,&#8221; gently interposed his wife,&ndash;an
intellectual-looking woman, with a face expressive
of goodness,&ndash;&#8220;the minister will not care to
hear of war to-day;&#8221; adding, with a blush,
&#8220;You must excuse us, sir; but it is so long since
we have seen one of your profession, or attended
religious services, that the days seem too much
alike; there is little here to remind us that the
Sabbath should be kept holy. O, it is so dreadful&ndash;so
like heathenism&ndash;to live without the
ordinances of the gospel! No Sunday school for
our children and youth, no servant of God to
counsel the dying, comfort the bereaved, and
point the heavy-laden to Christ!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Such a state of things must, indeed, be a
great trial to those who love the Saviour,&#8221; I observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and what adds to the trial,&#8221; she continued,
&#8220;is, that members of churches, after they
have been here awhile, fall into great laxity in
respect to the Lord&#8217;s day. Those who were exemplary
east, are here seen starting upon or returning
from a business journey on Sunday. O,
we need some one to gather these straying sheep,
and unite them by the public means of grace:
many of them, I doubt not, are secretly longing
for this. For more than a year I have been
praying that God would send a servant of his
this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And sometimes, I dare say, you have felt
almost discouraged,&#8221; I suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, weeping; &#8220;but last week
something came to strengthen my faith, and later,
intelligence that you were to visit us. Months
ago I wrote east for a donation of good reading
to scatter among the settlers, but received no response
till, last Tuesday, a package of books,
tracts, and religious papers arrived. In one of
the papers was an article entitled &#8216;The Pulpit
and the Beech Tree.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; said the husband, passing her the
sheet; &#8220;better read it to the parson; there&#8217;ll be
plenty of time afore the meeting;&#8221; and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
glanced at a venerable clock screwed to a log
over the wide-mouthed clay-stick-and-stone fireplace.</p>
<p>She read as follows: &#8220;Nearly a score of years
ago, a pioneer sought a home in one of the Western
States. He selected a &#8216;quarter section&#8217; in
a dense wilderness, and soon entered upon the
arduous work of clearing a farm. He was a
man of athletic constitution, and well adapted to
cope with the trials on the frontier. He was in
the prime of life; and in those days a man was
famous according as he had &#8216;lifted axes upon the
thick trees.&#8217; This man was ranked among the
leading characters in that region. He could
bear up with fortitude under all trials and privations,
except those of a religious kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before his removal to the west, he had enjoyed
the privileges of a large and well-regulated
church, in which he had for years been a prominent
member. To be thus suddenly deprived of
those blessed means of grace caused him many
painful feelings, and at times almost incapacitated
him for ordinary duties. This subject pressed so
heavily on his mind, that he often sought relief
in laying his wants before God in prayer. One
day he enjoyed near access to the throne while on
his knees in a secluded part of the forest. He
prayed earnestly that God would make that wilderness
and solitary place glad with the sound of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the gospel. He asked for the church privileges
to which he had been accustomed, and he felt
assured that God could grant them. So much
was he engaged in pleading for this blessing,
that he forgot his work. His family looked for
his return to dinner, but he came not. They
were alarmed, and, making search, found him
on his knees. To this man of God there was
something peculiarly pleasant in the memory of
that approach to the mercy-seat. He loved the
spot on which he had knelt, and determined to
mark it. It was by the side of a beech tree.
He &#8216;blazed&#8217; it, so that in after years it might remind
him of the incident that I have related.</p>
<p>&#8220;That prayer was speedily answered. God
put it into the hearts of the people of that region
to build a sanctuary in the desert. They have
now the stated means of grace. That pioneer is
one of the officers of the church. The membership
is near eighty. The cause of religion
seems to be flourishing among them. Not long
since it was my privilege to preach in their house
of worship; it was filled with an intelligent congregation.
At the close of the services, the old
man gave me a history of his praying under the
beech tree, and, with tears in his eyes, closed
by saying, &#8216;That tree stood only about five feet
from the very spot where you stood while preaching
for us to-night.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said she, at the conclusion of the
narrative, &#8220;I felt that this was a word in season
to me. I fell upon my knees, and, with increased
earnestness, pleaded for the privileges of
the gospel, and rose feeling, as did the pioneer,
that God would grant the request. But how did
my heart leap with glad surprise the next day,&ndash;that
is, last Wednesday,&ndash;when a neighbor
called to consult me about a place for you to
preach in!&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was time for service. There was the
same thronged attendance and absorbed attention
as in the morning. How delightful to proclaim
the tidings of great joy to those who are
hungering for the word of life! How different
from ministering to fashionable worldly hearers,
who gather in the house of God for intellectual
entertainment, or from motives of custom, respectability,
or ostentation, and who are hardened
by the very abundance of spiritual instruction!</p>
<p>At the close of the services, with the social
freedom of western intercourse, I was introduced
to most present, and they all seemed anxious that
I should make a home in their neighborhood.
How different it would be to settle with this new
people, on the precarious subsistence which I
might get for my family here, preaching, and
perhaps keeping house, in a log cabin, from the
situation I must fill, should I accept the call
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
extended by the large and wealthy church in
N. A frontier parish on a prairie, on the outskirts
of civilization, and a city parish,&ndash;what a
contrast! But my heart is strongly drawn towards
this people. Should I remain with them,
what would my money-loving, place-seeking,
eastern friends say?</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I have passed another delightful Sabbath,
notwithstanding certain trifling violations of the
proprieties of worship as observed in eastern
assemblies.</p>
<p>It struck me quite ludicrously, at first, to see
mother&#8217;s listening to the preaching while nursing
or dandling their infants. Yesterday a fat, burly
baby, who, by some singular good fortune, had
an apple,&ndash;for we never see that fruit here,&ndash;let
it drop from his fat fist, and it rolled nearly to
my feet; and the mother, not in the least disconcerted,
gravely came and picked it up, and returned
it to her boy. Nobody, however, was
disturbed by the incident; all appeared to take it
as a matter of course. And I confess I like this
absence of fastidious conventionalities. Why
should the mother be kept from the house of God
because she may not bring her child with her?
&#8220;Suffer the little children to come unto me, and
forbid them not,&#8221; said the great Preacher when
the disciples would drive out of <i>his</i> congregation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
the mothers and their infants. Is the servant
more particular than his Lord?</p>
<p>Then, too, the uncouth garments of many of
my log-cabin hearers,&ndash;how unlike the elegant
and costly apparel worn in our eastern sanctuaries!
But I like the western way best as to dress.
I enjoy seeing the poor, in his plain attire, sitting
unabashed by the side of the man in &#8220;goodly
apparel.&#8221; And when I consider what thousands
of starving souls are kept out of Christian
churches because they cannot dress in broadcloth
and silk, and how much money is wasted
and vanity indulged by the bedizened crowds
that throng our sanctuaries, I am thankful that
the reign of fashion is unknown on the frontier.</p>
<p>But these hardy pioneers are bold and independent
thinkers. The preacher must show himself
&#8220;a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,
<i>rightly</i> dividing the word of truth,&#8221; if he would
keep his hold on their respect. It will not do to
be careless even in teaching the Sabbath school.
I was suddenly reminded of this yesterday.
Speaking on the subject of benevolence, I had
remarked that the poorest of us, if we were careful
not to waste, might have something that we
could spare as well as not to those needier than
ourselves. And I inquired if any scholar could
tell me what scripture enforced this lesson. As
no one responded, I read the account of the multiplying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
of the loaves and fishes when Christ fed
the fainting multitudes; and coming to the words,
&#8220;Gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost,&#8221;
I asked, &#8220;Do not these words show that we ought
to save the pieces, that we may give them to the
hungry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; promptly answered a lad of about
sixteen.</p>
<p>Thinking he had misunderstood the question, I
repeated it, saying, &#8220;I asked, Thomas,&#8221;&ndash;for
that was the boy&#8217;s name,&ndash;&#8220;if this language
does not teach that we should save what we are
apt to throw away, that we may have something
to give the poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think it does,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; I inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jesus told the disciples to share the nice new
loaves with the people, and to keep the bits and
ends for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was right. I had unconsciously been making
that great miracle of mercy teach stinginess!
How often I had heard it explained to polished
audiences in New England in the same way, and
not a criticism offered. Yet the one who pointed
out this strangely-common error was a child belonging
to one of the most thriftless of these
frontier families. His name is Jones; and he is, I
think, a lad of promise, in whom I am becoming
much interested, as also in his father, a restless,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
singular being, but who is more of a man, in
my judgment, than he seems.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I am getting to feel more and more deeply
that duty calls me to labor here. If it were not
for my dear wife and children, I should decide
at once to remain. But how could she get along
in this out-of-the-world place? Can she relinquish
the comforts of her eastern home, and share
with me, for the Master&#8217;s sake, the privations of
the wilderness? The settlers are kind, and say
we shall not suffer. A subscription paper has
been started, and has already a goodly array of
names; and brother Palmer&ndash;an excellent man
of some means&ndash;says he will furnish me money
with which to build a neat cottage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>TOM&#8217;S VICTORY.</h3>
</div>
<p>Tom retired to bed the night after his mother
had confided to him the history of his father&#8217;s
business trials, feeling that she had conferred an
honor upon him in thus sharing with him her life-secret,
and that he understood his parents as he
never did before. He was conscious, also, that
she had put him under new obligation to be always
frank with her, as she had been with him; that
she had, in fact, made the obligation very sacred,
for he realized that it was an act of condescension
in her thus to make him the repository of her
secrets, while to share his with her was but the
duty of a child, and for his own advantage. And
he thought, &#8220;How can I now desert the family
for any imaginary good, and leave her to reproach
me by her patient cross-bearing for dear father
and the children&#8217;s sake?&#8221;</p>
<p>It cost him a bitter struggle to act in accordance
with this view. In the darkness of the night he
wrestled long and hard to put down the wish to
free himself from the burden that was now laid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
upon his conscience. He, the squatter&#8217;s son,
in his wretched life, had built up a golden future
for himself, as the ambitious young, of every condition,
are sure to do when once the heart is
roused to wish, and the mind to plan, for great
things. And now, to give it all up, and come
down to the cheerless drudgery of home-service
in <i>such</i> a home,&ndash;it could not be expected
that he could do this, only after a severe conflict
with his own nature, if at all. It is true his
mother had exhorted him to wait for Providence
to open the door before him. But he could not
help recalling, with an aching heart, through
how many long, weary years she had waited; and
what door of relief had been opened for her?
And was she not a thousand fold more deserving
of such an interposition than he? He reflected on
this point till his brain was in a whirl; the more
he pondered the matter, the darker it seemed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am called,&#8221; he reasoned, &#8220;to keep by the
family if I never see brighter days&ndash;that&#8217;s the
meaning of her words, and the demands of my
lot. Am I ready to do this&ndash;to be true to duty,
if it involves, as it has to her, poverty, seclusion
from privileges, toil, suffering, obscurity?&#8221;</p>
<p>He knew that he ought thus to decide, and to
decide cheerfully. But he could not. He tried
again and again to reach the decision only to
recoil from it. His will was powerless to calm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
the rebellion within. Ah, the pioneer&#8217;s ragged
son had been precipitated into a solemn moral crisis,
which tested him, and showed him how weak
he was! The tumult of feeling, and sharpness
of the battle, had, at length, cast him into utter
despair, when his mother&#8217;s remark concerning
his father&#8217;s mistake in setting about getting rich
by the strength of his own will, abruptly recurred
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did she mean by that?&#8221; he asked; and
he sat bolt upright in bed to consider the point.</p>
<p>He could not, however, quite master the idea,
and wished his mother was awake, that she might
explain herself. Then his mind returned to the
subject, and lo, the mist rolled away, and the
truth shone out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see it: father should have sought direction
and strength of God. And that is just what I
ought to do. He can give me grace to perform
my duty,&ndash;yes, even to choose it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Tom, under the inspiration of the light
that was breaking in upon his soul, resolved,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask God to enable me to do as mother has
advised, and as I see to be right in the circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>And covering his face with his hands, he lifted
up his heart in prayer. As he prayed, a heavenly
peace seemed to pervade his whole being. It
stole upon him so gently and unexpectedly, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
he felt like shouting praises to God; and at last,
unable to keep his marvellous happiness to himself,
he called, softly,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you wish, my son?&#8221; she asked, always
ready to answer her children&#8217;s calls.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, mother,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I have been struggling
and praying, and I&#8217;ve got the victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly she was kneeling on the rough floor
by his side,&ndash;she understood him,&ndash;and tears
of grateful joy ran down her face, and she
said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is as I would have it, Tom. God has taken
you up, and all will be well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next morning Tom arose with a peaceful,
serious face. His mother did not allude to the
happy change that had transpired within him
during the night, but as she busied herself about
breakfast, she would occasionally wipe away the
tears, for her heart was full.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said he, as they finished their frugal
meal, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking it would be a good
plan to get up all the wood we can while the
weather is pleasant. Winter&#8217;ll be coming along
by and by, and it&#8217;ll be so nice to have a warm
fire all the time then, and not have to wade
through the snow after something to burn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;we have not had our Indian
summer yet; and while that lasts we shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
use but little fuel, and if you and the children are
smart, you can get quite a pile ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is the beautiful spell we have in fall
called Indian summer?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; replied his mother, &#8220;the Indians
were in the habit of attacking the white settlements
then; they don&#8217;t go on their war expeditions
after cold weather sets in. And,&#8221; she added,
sighing, &#8220;I shall be glad when snow comes, for
I shall feel that we are safe until spring opens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Allens are dreadful mad about their cattle,&#8221;
remarked Tom. &#8220;The old man tracked
them to a ravine in the woods, and found that his
oxen had been killed and dressed: the horns and
hide lay on the ground, and the blood was scarcely
cold, but not an Indian was to be seen. He
couldn&#8217;t even find a trail, and he&#8217;s an old Indian-fighter,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have any Indians been seen near here,
since?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Mr. Payson, the missionary, saw one
the other morning as he was going from Root
River settlement to Slough Creek. He was passing
the Norwegian&#8217;s cabin, near the grove, when
suddenly a Sioux galloped by on his pony, giving
a loud whoop as he rode out of sight. And Mrs.
Pingry had a great scare. Her husband was
away after supplies, and she was alone about her
work, when the door opened and an Indian stalked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
in and took a seat. Pretty soon a second came,
and did the same, and then another; until a dozen
sat round the room, silently smoking their pipes.
She says she knew by their manner and the way
they were painted that they intended mischief.
She determined, however, not to appear frightened,
and went on with her work. Soon one of
them got up and broke open her husband&#8217;s trunk,
and then the rest fell to rummaging the house,
helping themselves to whatever they wished; and
she was expecting they would next assault her,
when, to her relief, she heard the barking of a
dog, and the rumbling of wheels, at which the
savages took alarm, and in a moment were gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what,&#8221; asked Mrs. Jones, &#8220;do the settlers
think of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, they only laugh about it. They don&#8217;t expect
any serious trouble. They say that the
chiefs have had a grand talk with the government
agent, and declare that they wish to be on
good terms with us. But some of our people do
all they can to provoke the Indians, and say they
would like to have a brush with the red-skins!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s that?&#8221; he exclaimed, as loud shouts
and the barking of dogs broke on their ears.
Mrs. Jones and Tom hurried to the door, and saw
some men and boys chasing a large animal across
the prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;A bear! a bear!&#8221; cried a neighbor, rushing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
breathlessly up to Tom, saying, &#8220;Is your father
at home? Tell him to come on, and we&#8217;ll pepper
his carcass!&#8221; and without waiting for an answer,
or explaining whose carcass he meant, he hastened
after the others.</p>
<p>The creature that they were pursuing was so
fat that he did not run very swiftly, and the dogs
gained on him; aware of which, he was making
desperate efforts to gain the shelter of a small
grove not far off, while stringing along for quite
a distance behind were his pursuers. Some
were hatless, a few had guns, but most were
armed with pitchforks or clubs; and one man, in
his zeal, carried a piece of rusty stove-pipe, although
what use he proposed to put it to in capturing
Bruin, it was difficult to imagine, unless
he intended, should Bear gain the grove, to <i>smoke
him out</i> with it. The truth is, he was putting up
a stove in his cabin when the cry of &#8220;Bear, bear,&#8221;
interrupted his labors, and he joined the chase,
forgetting that he held anything in his hand. He
was wiry, lank, and long-legged, with sandy hair
that came down straight and thin upon his shoulders,
and being without his coat, with pants that
reached only half way between his knees and
ankles, he cut a ludicrous figure as he straddled
on, followed by a short, dumpy man, who, waddle
as ambitiously as he might, swiftly fell behind,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
without, however, seeming in the least discouraged.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, they are surrounding the grove,&#8221; said
Tom, as the men and boys spread out from the
centre till they had encompassed Bruin&#8217;s leafy
retreat.</p>
<p>Soon there was the report of guns, and not
long after, the hunters returned, looking tired and
disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bear must have got away,&#8221; said Mrs.
Jones.</p>
<p>But Charley came rushing towards her, and,
throwing up his cap, cried,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, isn&#8217;t it fun! It wasn&#8217;t a bear, mother; it
was only Mr. Abbott&#8217;s black hog that he lost last
fall, and thought was dead. He had run wild,
feeding on roots and acorns, and was awful fat.
But they didn&#8217;t know &#8217;twas a hog till they shot
him, the dogs kept up such a yelping, and the
grass and bushes hid him so. They&#8217;ve gone after
a wagon to take him home.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Tom was at work making an opening in
the fence nearest the woods; seeing which, Charley
called out,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you doing that for, Tom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking,&#8221; answered Tom, pleasantly,
&#8220;that we shall want some wood near the cabin
next winter, instead of digging it out of the snow,
and I&#8217;m fixing a place to drag it through.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, children,&#8221; added the mother, &#8220;Tom and
I have been talking it over. Suppose you take
hold together and see how big a pile you can get
up. It will be so nice to have plenty of wood to
cook the corn-cakes with, and keep us comfortable
when it&#8217;s freezing weather!&#8221;</p>
<p>The project pleased the youngsters, even to
Bub, and, headed by Tom, they began at once
to put it into execution.</p>
<p>It is customary in new countries for the first
comers to help themselves freely to the trees on
government land, for logs with which to construct
their cabins, and to rive into shingles and saw
into boards; and many a sinewy oak had fallen
before the frontiersman&#8217;s axe in the woods near
the Joneses, leaving the brawny limbs upon the
ground. There were also many dead trees still
standing, and from these sources dry, hard wood
of the best quality could always be obtained.</p>
<p>Tom directed operations. The limbs and small
dead trees were thrown or dragged in piles a certain
distance towards the field; from there another
took them to the opening in the fence, and from
thence others of the youngsters pulled them up
to the house. The girls and boys had a merry
time of it, Sarah making the woods ring with her
bird-like voice as she sang at her task, while
many a joke was exchanged by the lively little
company. But no one of them entered on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
labor with more zeal, and a higher appreciation
of his own services, than Bub.</p>
<p>&#8220;That child is always under foot,&#8221; said Eliza,
as she stumbled over him while tugging along a
scrawny limb.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to go into the house,&#8221; said Tom;
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll get hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; answered the child, &#8220;tause I
dot to tarry in the wood;&#8221; and seizing a long
branch under one dimpled arm, and a short, heavy
one under the other, to make good his words,
with the will of an older head, he started for the
cabin.</p>
<p>Out from under his arm would be wrenched
the long one by some bush beside the path, and
Bub would pick it up and pull at it until it had
cleared itself, when down would go the big piece
from the other arm. Then he would bravely lift
it again, his baby frock going up with it; and
thus dropping his load and picking it up, with an
occasional tumble, which he would not cry about,
he reached the house, dragging his load in through
the door, to the imminent danger of knocking
over the old stove. He now rested from his
labors to eat a cold potato and a piece of his
mother&#8217;s much-loved corn-cake, which, while
disposing of, he dropped asleep, his rosy cheeks
crammed to their utmost capacity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; cried Charley, coming noisily in to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
see if dinner was most ready, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you
keep to work, like the rest of us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bub resumed eating, and replied, dignifiedly,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tause I found out that it wasn&#8217;t fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unexpected effect of his answer on Charley,
who received it with uproarious laughter,
highly offended the child; and when Charley was
out of sight, he said to his mother,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I isn&#8217;t never going to work no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, why not?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tause I don&#8217;t like to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you&#8217;ll never make a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do men have to work?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t be a man,&#8221; he answered, decidedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed his mother; &#8220;what, then,
will you be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sail be a missernary, and walk wound, and
wear dold dlasses!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>A SURPRISE.</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me, sir, if I can find a conveyance
for myself and children to L&ndash;&ndash;, Minnesota?&#8221;
inquired a lady of the attentive clerk at a
hotel in the thriving young town of Dacotah,
Iowa.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no stage running to that point,&#8221; he
replied; &#8220;but we can send a team with you, if
you wish to go to so much expense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like,&#8221; answered the lady, smiling,
&#8220;to get there with as little cost as I can. My
husband is a missionary. I am on my way to
join him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will see what I can do for you,&#8221; returned
the clerk, bowing respectfully; and, stepping into
the bar-room, he asked,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any one here going to L&ndash;&ndash; to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall go half way there,&#8221; said a short,
sharp-nosed, black-eyed man, who sat reading
an eastern paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you take a passenger or two?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty well loaded,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;but
I always find room for one more, seeing it
pays.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a clergyman&#8217;s wife and children,&#8221; said the
clerk, in a lower tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, well,&#8221; replied the other, rising to his feet,
&#8220;they shall go along, pay or no pay;&#8221; and he
followed the clerk, who introduced the parties to
each other with,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sawyer&ndash;Mrs. Payson. He will take
you as far as he goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how far is that?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;About twenty miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how shall I get over the remainder of the
distance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be concerned about that,&#8221; replied the
man, heartily. &#8220;I guess there&#8217;ll be a way to
forward you all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in a half hour his team was before the
door, waiting to take her farther into the wilderness.
A pair of stout iron-grays harnessed
into a long, open wagon, affording space for a
large variety of boxes and packages, and three
rows of cushionless seats, constituted the conveyance.
Its owner had been on a trading expedition,
but, with an eye to &#8220;the main chance,&#8221; was
prepared to catch some of the travel going westward.
The wagon was crowded with passengers;
and, disposing of the three children,&ndash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
delicate, intelligent little boy and his two sisters&ndash;in
the laps of those already seated, the teamster
assisted the mother to a seat at his side.
Their presence, it was evident, excited much interest;
for the manner and dress of the little family
betrayed New England birth and culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your husband,&#8221; said the owner of the conveyance,
as his horses trotted sturdily along, &#8220;rode
up with me the other day. He had been down
to the Mississippi waiting for you a whole week,
and the landlord at McGreggor&#8217;s Landing said
he was the bluest man he ever saw, because you
did not arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry that he was anxious on my account,&#8221;
replied the wife, with a merry laugh.
&#8220;He didn&#8217;t wish me to venture on the journey
alone with the children, and wrote that he would
return for me if I could not find suitable company;
but, not wishing to take him from his
labors, I packed up, and took our darlings
along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you didn&#8217;t meet with any accident on
the way,&#8221; observed a man on the back seat.
&#8220;You was pretty resolute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I came near losing one of my little
girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did it happen?&#8221; asked a motherly-looking
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in the depot at Springfield. The children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
were thirsty, and, charging them not to stir
until I came back, I crossed the room for water.
There was a great crowd rushing here and there,
trains were coming and going, all was bustle
and confusion, and I hurried, not having been
away but a moment; but little Fannie, my youngest
girl, was missing. Helen, the eldest, had
been so taken up with the sights and sounds
about her, that she did not know that her sister
was gone. I was almost frantic with fear, she
had so suddenly and completely disappeared.
So, throwing my bonnet back upon my shoulders
to attract attention, I cried at the top of my
lungs,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;My child! my child! I&#8217;ve lost my child!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Child lost! child lost!&#8221; shouted a number
of voices, repeating the description I gave of
her. Nobody seemed to have seen her; and a
terrible dread that I might not find her wrung
my heart, when, to my joy, above the din, I heard
some one exclaim,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s found! she&#8217;s found! Where&#8217;s the
mother?&#8221; and a gentleman, holding her aloft,
brought her to me. He was deeply agitated,
and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your little girl, madam, came very near being
killed. I found her under the car between
two of the wheels, playing with them, saying,
&#8216;Car may hurt a me; car may hurt a me.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
The last bell had rung, and I had barely time
to drag her off the track when the train started.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been a great care for you,&#8221; remarked
a passenger, &#8220;to bring your children on
so long a journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was, indeed,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Generally the
worst part of it was in getting them into the
trains: the children are so small, and the rush
of passengers so great, that they were in danger
of being trampled on, or prevented from getting
aboard in season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody looks out for Number One at such
times,&#8221; said a man. &#8220;I often think that we see
more of the selfishness of human nature while
travelling than under any other circumstances.
I suppose you were left to get along as best you
could with your little ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Sometimes, however,
a stranger, bound the same way, would
give us a helping hand; but often he would
blunder so as to make matters worse. Once I
was both amused and frightened. I was struggling
to place my children on a train just starting,
and, making little headway. I called out, &#8216;Will
some one help my children into the cars?&#8217;
when one of the largest, fattest men I ever saw,
who was panting and puffing from his unusual
efforts at hurrying, caught up my little boy, and,
trotting on like an elephant, he struck his foot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
against a stone, and came down sprawling into
the sand, uttering a great, wild cry, and giving
my little boy a throw at the same time. I felt
sorry for the man, but thought I should die laughing
at the queer figure he cut. And, ungrateful
as it seemed, I was obliged, in going for my boy,
to pass around our huge friend, and ride off,
leaving him to pick himself up at his leisure.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was much merriment at this recital,
which was increased by a portly Englishman
behind her saying, in a jolly way,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi feel as if hi could happreciate that story,
mem!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how do you think you&#8217;ll like living
west?&#8221; asked the motherly woman. &#8220;It seems
to me that the likes of you won&#8217;t know how to
put up with our rough ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O,&#8221; replied the clergyman&#8217;s wife, with an
enthusiasm which showed what manner of spirit
she was of, &#8220;I did not come out here for enjoyment,
but to cheer and help my husband in laboring
for Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered the other, wiping a tear from
her eye, &#8220;the land knows we need such folks
among us; and if we don&#8217;t have things as nice
as you do your way, I hope you&#8217;ll find us westerners
ready to do what we can for the good
cause. Most of us have seen better times, and
have known what it was to go to meeting every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
Sunday, and do our mite towards supporting
preaching, and we are willing to do it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See, mother,&#8221; exclaimed little Helen,&ndash;a
bright, wide-awake miss of six years,&ndash;&#8220;what
a large garden!&#8221;</p>
<p>The team had passed the irregular ridges of
the bluffs extending inland from the Mississippi,
and had attained the summit of a gentle swell of
land commanding an extensive prairie view, and
the whole landscape was bedecked with flowers
of every hue and shape. The child&#8217;s wondering
eyes danced with delight, and she said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, isn&#8217;t the man who owns this great
garden very rich?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This don&#8217;t belong to any one man, my dear,&#8221;
replied her mother, smiling; &#8220;it is one of <i>God&#8217;s</i>
gardens. He planted all these flowers, and made
them grow without anybody&#8217;s help. All these
are wild flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O,&#8221; exclaimed the child, &#8220;how good he is!&ndash;isn&#8217;t
he, mother? Has God such a garden where
our new home is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect he has,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;for out
here, my child, it&#8217;s almost all garden. You
might ride thousands of miles, and not see a stone,
or any sand&ndash;nothing but the green grass and
the sweet blooming flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O,&#8221; cried Blue-eye, clapping her hands,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad we&#8217;ve come west!&ndash;aren&#8217;t you,
mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>The passengers were delighted with the prattle
of the dear girl, and the matronly lady who
had her in charge could not forbear giving her a
kiss, and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will meet with nothing more unpleasant
than prairie flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>But just then the child&#8217;s bright eyes caught
sight of a settler pursuing his lonely way with
his gun on his shoulder, his tall figure standing
in bold relief against the sky, although he was
several miles in the distance, and she asked,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma, is that a wild man?&#8221; And, later,
seeing a cow grazing, she inquired, &#8220;Is that a
wild cow?&#8221;</p>
<p>The next night, about sundown, Mr. Sawyer
deposited the missionary&#8217;s family at Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s
snug western cottage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mrs. Lincoln, laughing, as she
took her guest&#8217;s things, &#8220;you&#8217;ve stolen a march
on your husband this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he here?&#8221; asked Mrs. Payson, with a
disappointed air.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;He spent a week at the
Mississippi, waiting for you. And, fearing you
might get carried by, or injured in leaving the
steamer,&ndash;for you know little ceremony is used
towards passengers or their goods,&ndash;he visited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
each boat as it arrived, and had the porter at the
hotel call him up at every boat through the night,
inquiring of the passengers if they had seen a
lady of your description with three young children;
and hearing, since he returned, that one resembling
you had gone to the Landing higher up
on the river, he went there yesterday, hoping to
meet you, and bring you back with him. He&#8217;ll
probably get here late this evening; and won&#8217;t
we give him a surprise?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was about nine o&#8217;clock when the missionary
returned, alone, anxious, and dejected.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look as if you found your lost wife
and babies,&#8221; said his host, sympathizingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and I don&#8217;t know what to make of it. I
inquired thoroughly. I looked the papers over
also, but did not find that there had been any
railroad accident of late. I am afraid she has
been taken sick on the way. It was barbarous
in me to listen a moment to the idea of her coming
all the way alone, with three children, from
Massachusetts to Minnesota. I ought to have
insisted on her remaining at home until I could
have gone for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; suggested Mr. Lincoln, &#8220;she
thought it wasn&#8217;t prudent to venture on such a
journey, and wrote you so, but the letter has
miscarried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know her too well to think so,&#8221; responded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
the minister. &#8220;She has started on her way here.
She had decided to do so as a matter of duty;
and, having made her mind up on that point, she
would come right on if she met with a railroad
accident every other train&ndash;if she is a delicate
little body.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you look tired enough to drop,&#8221; said
Mrs. Lincoln, abruptly, turning her head to conceal
a smile. &#8220;I think you had better retire
early.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clergyman was quite taken aback at this
piece of advice; but Mr. Lincoln relieved his
astonishment by saying,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife, hoping that you might be cheered by
the arrival of your family, has been fixing up
your room a bit, and I suppose she won&#8217;t rest to-night
unless she sees how you like the improvements.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Mrs. Lincoln opening the door into his
apartment, the missionary saw before him his
three children, sleeping peacefully in their nice
beds, and his wife seated in a rocking-chair, exercising
a world of self-control, in order to carry
out the plot of surprising him.</p>

<p>in staid old Scotland, how would he have sung
if his lot had been cast amid the vicissitudes of
frontier life on an American prairie?</p>
<p>We speak of the uncertainties of all earthly
expectations where society organized, helps man
in a thousand ways to achieve his plans; but
there is nothing settled in a new country:
everything is in embryo, and therefore disappointments
are indefinitely multiplied. When the
immigrant arrives at his destination, he soon finds
that his most reasonable projects prove to be the
veriest air-castles, and that his reliance must be
on Providence and his own strong arm. This
state of things is specially trying to the man of
small means and unaccustomed to physical toil,
as was the case with Mr. Payson. The settlers,
especially those of religious character, had made,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
in true western style, many and generous promises
to induce him to live among them. They
designed to keep their engagements with him;
but a thousand contingencies were continually
arising, which they could not foresee, to render
the fulfilment of their agreements impossible.
But perhaps no failure in this direction had tried
the missionary so much as that connected with
the erection of a dwelling-house. Mr. Palmer
had voluntarily made him the offer of money for
that purpose, and if any man could be depended
upon, it was he; but he had invested his funds in
the new town. He was a prudent man, and when
the proposal was made him by the two proprietors
to join them in the enterprise, he was disinclined
to do so. They were irreligious men, stirring,
energetic workers, but devoid of interest in
&#8220;things unseen,&#8221; and therefore could not be expected
to care for the present and future moral
condition of the settlement. Yet we should do
them the justice to say that they were not indifferent
to the religious welfare of their village,
only that, not being religious men, they would not
take the matter in charge themselves; they needed
a leader, both to plan and to set a wholesome
example, and this was one reason for their asking
Mr. Palmer to become a partner. This reason
was a weighty one with him; but before deciding
the question, he consulted with Mr. Payson.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>Laying the whole matter before him, he
asked,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of my engaging in this
thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do hope,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;that, if you can
make it pecuniarily successful, you will become
a town owner. I should feel that I had a pillar
to lean upon in all my endeavors for the social
and religious good of this people, and it seems to
me that there can be no risk in it; we have
everything here to make a town,&ndash;water-power,
timber, limestone quarries for building material,
abundance of clean prairie land for agricultural
purposes, and sooner or later a railroad must pass
very near here, as it is on the great travelled
route to the important points west and north.
Emigration is coming in well; we have a religious
meeting established, and I hope soon we shall
have a school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the way it seems to me,&#8221; said Mr.
Palmer; &#8220;and it appears also, that I might do a
great deal of good by using aright the power a
town owner might have.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he decided to make the investment. But
mishap after mishap occurred to thwart the enterprises
of the town owners; and while their expenses
were large, the returns were so small that
Mr. Palmer came to the preacher one day, and
with emotion said,&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Payson, I fear I shall have to disappoint
you about the money I promised to let you have
for the building of your cottage.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a heavy blow to the missionary, and
his friend knew too well that it would be, for Mr.
Payson had set his heart on having a comfortable
home provided for his family when they should
arrive. Many a pleasant bit of correspondence
had passed between himself and wife on the subject
of the pretty white cottage, on the eighty-acre
lot adjoining the town, and the joy of meeting
her was overshadowed by the thought that
she had come to a homeless wilderness, while
expecting something so different; and when she
asked repeatedly if the cottage was ready, and
when he was going to take her to see it, in his
unhappiness he avoided a direct reply, which,
with the ominous silence of the good friends by
whom they were entertained, led her to conjecture
how matters stood; and one day she lifted the
weight in a measure from his heart by saying,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be very strange, while almost everybody
in a new country are obliged to live in
log cabins, if we should be enough better off
to put up a framed house. I don&#8217;t believe you
have been able to yet; it is too much to expect.
But never mind; if others can live within log
walls for the sake of making money, we certainly
can for a higher motive.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just like yourself,&#8221; said he, gratefully, relating
the facts as we have recited them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what are we going to do?&#8221; she inquired;
&#8220;we ought not to think of accepting the hospitality
of this generous-hearted family much longer.
Their house is already so crowded, it puts them
to great inconvenience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am aware of it,&#8221; said her husband. &#8220;Mr.
Palmer has a little cabin which he has offered
me for temporary use until I can put up something
on my claim; but it is so rough and lonely, that
on your account I have not felt like saying anything
to you about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O,&#8221; said she, merrily, &#8220;do take me there to-day;
it would be so romantic to live in a log
cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, their host&#8217;s team being chartered, they went
to look at the &#8220;rent.&#8221; It was a funny wee loggery,
hastily put up for pre-emption purpose,
standing in a small, enclosed field near the river,
two miles from town, the nearest neighbor being
Mr. Jones, who lived a mile and a half farther
down the stream.</p>
<p>Mr. Palmer, in anticipation of the visit, had
been there before them, and put in a whole glass
window, laid the rough boards, that constituted
the floor, more closely, and put up some shelves
for a cupboard in a corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is elegance itself!&#8221; exclaimed the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
woman, laughing heartily: &#8220;get a few chairs,
and a stove, husband, and we&#8217;ll move right in;
and see,&#8221; she added, looking out of the door;
&#8220;there are potatoes here that have not been
dug&ndash;quite a crop: perhaps you can buy the
right to use them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, yes,&#8221; replied her husband; &#8220;brother Palmer
says we can have the use of the cabin free, and
all there is about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fish in the river, too, I suppose,&#8221; said
she, stepping to the fence, and peering over the
river brink.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you won&#8217;t get fish enough to get
sick on them,&#8221; said a voice near; and, Mr. Jones
emerged from a clump of bushes, his gun on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our neighbor,&#8221; said the minister; &#8220;my
wife, Mr. Jones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking up a cage to put your bird in?&#8221; asked
the squatter.</p>
<p>The minister replied affirmatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;You found that eighty-acre lot just as I told
ye&ndash;didn&#8217;t ye?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did your &#8216;brother Smith&#8217; give it up like
a Christian?&#8221; he pursued.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I am the proprietor of it now,&#8221; said
the minister, good-naturedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And he didn&#8217;t charge you anything for giving
up what was not his&ndash;did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the missionary; &#8220;he did not charge
me anything for the claim, although he seemed
to think it right that I should give him something
for the improvements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Improvements! Yes, I suppose he expects
some pay for the saw logs he stole from the lot,
while he had acres on acres of timber of his own.
It&#8217;s no more&#8217;n fair that a Christian man should
be paid for the lumber he plunders from other
folks&#8217; land. You paid him for that, of course?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, no,&#8221; replied Mr. Payson; &#8220;he didn&#8217;t bring
in his bill for that. He had cleared and fenced
the ten-acre piece over the river, and he said he
didn&#8217;t wish to lose his labor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Jones, almost fiercely, &#8220;I
wasn&#8217;t aware, elder, that you employed him to
do that little job; I thought that was done last
year, &#8217;fore we knew anything &#8217;bout you in these
parts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said the missionary, coloring.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I rather think,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that he
got his pay for his work, as he expected to, in what
he took from the land. I never saw better corn
and wheat, let alone the potatoes and the pumpkins
that he raised on that river bottom; and as
to the rails, they belong where he took them from,
that eighty-acre lot that he robbed and impoverished,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
tilling the soil in the summer, and cutting
down the best trees in the winter, and working
what he didn&#8217;t care about into rails; and now he
turns around,&ndash;after having skimmed your milk,
when he had plenty of his own,&ndash;and tells you,
as a Christian brother, that you orter pay him for
taking off the cream, and making butter of it for
his own table. May I ask what he charged you
for the operation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He asked,&#8221; said the minister, &#8220;eighty dollars,
but concluded to take thirty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you form your church you&#8217;ll choose
him first deacon&ndash;won&#8217;t you?&#8221; said the squatter,
sneeringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neighbor Jones,&#8221; said the minister, quietly,
&#8220;I find that Mr. Smith&#8217;s character is pretty well
understood among the settlers. From all I can
learn, I judge that he has never been a member
of a church, but is one of a too large class, who
try to palm themselves off on religious people,
that they may the better carry out their own
wicked and selfish ends. I did not pay him the
thirty dollars because he had a right to ask it of
me, but because I had rather sacrifice something
than to expose the spiritual welfare of this people
by giving an occasion for a quarrel, however unjustly;
and, mark me, the time will come when
that money, small as the amount is, will be a
burden to the conscience of that man. But,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
added, suddenly changing the subject, &#8220;we expect
to have a raising on my lot day after to-morrow.
Cannot I rely on you for a lift?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what are you going to put up
there&ndash;a framed house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, no,&#8221; replied the minister, smiling, &#8220;only a
few logs. The town owners are going to let me
take down the log house they have used on the
other side of the river,&ndash;as the logs are so well
seasoned,&ndash;and put them up on my place; and,
wife,&#8221;&ndash;turning to her,&ndash;&#8220;we shall have to depend
on you for refreshments for the occasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have given me short notice,&#8221; she replied,
&#8220;but I can have things ready if you can manage
to get supplies, and a stove up in season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want a little help in getting started
here,&#8221; said Mr. Jones, &#8220;I&#8217;ll send up my Tom; I
guess he&#8217;d like to lend you a hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could he come to-day?&#8221; asked Mrs. Payson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send him right along,&#8221; said the squatter,
as he bent his steps towards home.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we going to do for a stove?&#8221; asked
the wife, as soon as he was out of sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be forthcoming,&#8221; said the minister.</p>
<p>Tom, having made his appearance, was requested
by Mr. Payson to take the team and go
to town, and say to Mr. Palmer that they had decided
to move into the cabin, and would like to
get settled before night; which message brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
Mr. Palmer back with Tom, accompanied by a
wagon-load, containing a large cooking-stove,
a bag of flour, some chairs, a little crockery, and
a supply of various eatables. And by nightfall
the missionary family were domiciled in the frontier
cabin; and the next morning you would have
thought the missionary&#8217;s wife already quite &#8216;westernized,&#8217;
with her neat calico and tidy apron, busy
in her preparations for the house-raising.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to stay in a borrowed house a
great while,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Husband, how soon do
you calculate that we can be housekeeping in
our own cabin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take some weeks, do our best,&#8221; he
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she rejoined, &#8220;I&#8217;ll set the time four
weeks from to-day; and if it isn&#8217;t ready then, I
shall go into it if I have to leave you behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>But how slowly everything dragged, except
the raising! The settlers went into that with right
good will; men and teams were busy drawing
the logs, while experienced hands placed them
properly upon each other, till the ridge-pole
crowned the whole. Then they sat down on
the grass to partake of the tempting eatables that
Tom and Mr. Payson had brought on the ground.
There were the light biscuits and the golden
butter, nice venison steaks for which they were
indebted to the rifle of Mr. Jones, dried apple
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
turnovers, and the sheets of crisp gingerbread,
loaf cake, and fragrant coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t get any whiskey at this raising!&#8221;
said Mr. Palmer, nudging his next neighbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;and it&#8217;s an example that I
hope will be often followed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was the door to be made and hung,
and the windows to be put in, and the crevices
between the logs to be mortared, and the floors
laid&ndash;long and tedious operations, where everybody
was over-busy, and labor could be hired
neither &#8220;for love nor money.&#8221; Mr. Payson found
that much of the work had to be done by himself,
with the occasional help of Tom. He was city-bred,
and his bodily strength feeble; but necessity
obliged him to perform prodigies of teaming, lifting,
and joinering, and even of quarrying stone
for the well that was being dug. A few weeks
had wrought a wonderful change in the man of
books; his study was wherever he chanced to be;
his white hands had become horny and browned,
his pale face tanned. His retiring habits had
given place to a broad sociality, his diffidence to
a generous self-reliance, and it seemed to him
that he could do and dare almost anything. From
early morning till late at night he worked to get
his log home ready, while his wife and little
ones remained in the solitary cabin by the riverside.
It was a long walk for him, however after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
toiling all day; and when the sky was overcast at
nightfall, he was in danger of getting lost. This
gave his wife much uneasiness; then she feared
that he might meet some prowling wolf, or other
beast, in the darkness; and when he was very
late, she would be sure to think he was lost, and
would ring her house-bell, which consisted of a
tin pan, on which she would drum vigorously
with the stove-lifter. She said he would recognize
that sound, she thought, at a great distance.</p>
<p>But the four weeks went by, and on account of
the difficulty of getting lumber, and other necessary
articles, the roof was still unshingled, and
the floor only half laid. The wife, like most
women, had a very good memory for dates. The
log cabin they occupied was open, and the prairie
winds cold and piercing, and for a few days she
had been quite ill; but that morning, after her
unsuspicious husband had left for his joinering,
Tom might have been seen guiding a yoke of
cattle, attached to a cart, into the enclosure, which,
after much &#8220;geeing&#8221; and &#8220;gee-hawing,&#8221; he managed
to make stand before the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlie,&#8221; said he, as that urchin made his
appearance from the inside of the cart, &#8220;you stand
by the cattle while I put the things aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>And bringing out a barrel filled with crockery
and other things, which Mrs. Payson had clandestinely
packed for the occasion, and the wash-boiler
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
full of eatables, and hanging the chairs
over the cart stakes, he took down the bedsteads,
and placed them in a manner that was highly
satisfactory to the energetic minister&#8217;s wife, and
tying up the bed-clothes in great bundles, deposited
them also; and saying to Mrs. Payson,
&#8220;I shall have to fix an easy place for you to
ride, as you&#8217;ve been sick,&#8221; he laid the hard
beds in the empty space which he had left for
that purpose in the cart, with the feather beds
above, saying,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, you won&#8217;t feel the motion much now;&#8221;
and assisting her to mount, she was enthroned on
her downy seat on the top of the load, with the
children in high glee by her side.</p>
<p>The steers, which were notoriously unruly, as
if aware that they had a minister&#8217;s wife aboard,
behaved with becoming decorum under Tom&#8217;s
wise supervision.</p>
<p>Now, it chanced that some careless hunter, firing
into the dry prairie grass on the other side of the
town, had started a fire. Mrs. Payson had noticed
in the morning that there was a smell of burning
in the air, and a hazy appearance, but had attached
no particular importance to it; but as they
approached the town, a scene of great magnificence
burst upon her. The fires, driven with
velocity before the wind, had swept over the prairies,
and reached the belt of woods, in a portion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
of which were the eighty acres that her husband
was at work upon. The flames were crackling
and roaring in the forests, burning up the dry
underbrush, shooting to the tops of the old dead
pines, so that the scene being constantly on her left,
was more or less in view for most of the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; asked Tom, in alarm.
&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better go back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think the fire has reached my husband&#8217;s
claim?&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>Tom scanned the appearance of the smoke
with a practised eye, and at length replied,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s not got as far as there yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it will?&#8221; she inquired, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the wind does not change, it must before a
great while,&#8221; he said, &#8220;although it will have to
cross the road, which will backen it some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it burn up the cabin, then?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid it would,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said she, firmly, &#8220;I said I would go
into that cabin in four weeks, and if it&#8217;s not burnt
down, I shall keep my word. At any rate we
shall be in season to see the fire!&#8221; Then she added,
looking grave, &#8220;I do hope, if it is the Lord&#8217;s
will, that the fire will be checked in time, my husband
has toiled so hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the cart turned up the main street of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
town, she caught sight of the cabin that was to
be her future home, and she saw her husband,
too, at the same moment, for there he sat on the
roof, gazing at the fire, which seemed to be dying
out. He heard the rumbling of the wheels as
they drew near, and as he caught sight of the
picturesque-looking object approaching, he called
out,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what under the canopy have we here?
Wife, and babies, and household effects! What
does this mean? You are not going to emigrate
farther west&ndash;are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll <i>de</i>scend from your elevated position,&#8221;
she replied, cheerily, &#8220;I&#8217;ll <i>con</i>descend to inform
you. Now,&#8221; she added, &#8220;you know I told you,
husband, I should move into the cabin to-day;
and did you ever know me to break my word?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said he, looking disconcerted, &#8220;I&#8217;m not
ready for you yet; the floor isn&#8217;t half laid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand it to have
you sweating up here all alone at your task, running
the risk of being devoured by the wolves,
or losing your way at night because you think
the cabin isn&#8217;t comfortable enough for me. Why,
you are as particular about having everything done
just so about this cabin, as you used to be, east, in
having every word exactly in its place when you
wrote your sermons. Please, now, just help Tom
unload, and set these things in, and I&#8217;ll have tea
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
ready directly, and we&#8217;ll be where we can cheer
you a bit. But what about this fire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our cabin has had a very narrow escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tom, coming up, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been out
to look, and the fire just came up to your line,
and then stopped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Payson was deeply affected by the intelligence,
for, knowing that no human power could
stay the advancing flames, upon the cabin top he
had been praying that the wind might change.
Was it in answer to his silent petitions that it had
taken place in so timely a manner?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>OLD MRS. SKINFLINT IN TROUBLE.&ndash;LOST IN THE WOODS.</h3>
</div>
<p>There is no man so bad as he might be&ndash;a
fact that everybody knows, but that most are
apt to forget in their estimate of those who have
offended their sense of right.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith had his virtues as well as faults;
perhaps more of the latter than the former; but
there were some mollifying circumstances to be
taken into the account in the summing up of his
character. His natural love of money had been
stimulated and intensified by the malign influence
of his wife. She was miserly when he married
her. To keep what she had, and get what she
could, was her ruling passion; besides which she
had a passion <i>for</i> ruling. And often, when her
husband&#8217;s gentler heart would be touched by a
tale of suffering, and his hand be opened to relieve
the distressed, would she interfere to prevent
the indulgence of the benevolent impulse;
and now, after some thirty years&#8217; matrimonial
moulding, he had become so assimilated to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
grasping spirit, and so accustomed to yield to her
stronger will, that his dealings in business made
him appear worse than he really was. In the
sale of the &#8220;eighty-acre lot&#8221; to the missionary,
about which much indignation was felt in the
settlement, Mrs. Smith was the chief actor.
Mr. Smith was the monkey employed to pull the
chestnuts out of the fire, although, it must be
confessed, he relished the chestnuts. She was a
crafty woman, and kept out of sight in the transaction
while she urged him on, so that people
saw only Mr. Smith in the wrong-doing, when,
if they could have peeped behind the curtain, they
would have seen that his &#8220;better half&#8221; was the
more guilty.</p>
<p>The thirty dollars which Mr. Smith finally
consented to take for the &#8220;improvements on the
claim,&#8221; Mr. Payson was unable to pay all at
once; he was, therefore, subjected to many vexatious
duns for the balance. Fearing that, at
last, her husband would relent, and the debt
might not all be realized, Mrs. Smith resolved
to turn collector herself. So, putting on her best
cap, and her faded black alpaca, she made her
way through the woods to the missionary&#8217;s cabin.</p>
<p>When she reached it, she found no one but
Tom and Bub within; for Mr. Lincoln had
called with his team, and taken the family to
dine at his house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is the minister to home?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;When will he be back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Tom; &#8220;but he expects
to attend a wedding this evening, and, as it&#8217;s
now &#8217;most four, I expect him every minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll take a chair
and wait. My husband has a small bill agin
him, and I thought maybe he&#8217;d just as lief pay
it now as any time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was garrulous and inquisitive, plying Tom
with all sorts of questions about the minister&#8217;s
family, much to the annoyance of the lad, who,
remembering that there were certain errands yet
to be done that afternoon,&ndash;for Tom was now
often at the cabin assisting the minister,&ndash;he
asked her if she would look after Bub while he
went to the village, saying he thought it likely
the family would return before he did. The old
lady rather liked the arrangement, as it would
give her a chance to inspect the housekeeping
of the minister&#8217;s wife; and, watching Tom
till he was well into town, she commenced her
examinations. First she opened the closet door
to see how the dishes were arranged, for she had
heard that once on a time the good man&#8217;s lady
had committed the great crime of writing a book;
and she had often remarked that &#8220;anybody that
could waste their time in sich a way must be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
master slack housekeeper.&#8221; To her disappointment,
however, she found that quite as good
order, and rather more taste, reigned there than in
her own pantry, but was relieved again a moment
at finding an unwashed plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as I thought,&#8221; she muttered, with a grunt
of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Having finished her leisurely inspection of the
cupboard, during which she smelled of the bread
to see if it was sour, broke off a bit of the cake
to see if it was extravagant, and sucked some
plum sauce from the ends of her fingers, she
started to peer under the bed to ascertain if there
was any dust there, when, hearing a noise, supposing
that the minister had come, she turned and
closed the closet door, and reseated herself, wiping
her mouth with her apron as she did so.
This change of posture brought her into full
view of the stairs leading to the loft above, which
humble place, under the roof, the clergyman
used for a study when he wished to be <i>very much</i>
retired. On the stairs, descending with solemn
step and slow, was Bub, with the minister&#8217;s old
hat on, which he kept above his eyes by one
chubby hand, and the minister&#8217;s steel-bowed
glasses resting on his nose, and the good man&#8217;s
dressing-gown trailing magnificently behind.
Bub&#8217;s manner showed that he felt his consequence
much increased by his clerical outfit, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
the benignant gravity of his face was edifying to
behold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness gracious!&#8221; exclaimed the old lady;
&#8220;what on airth you up to, you imp o&#8217; Satan?
Can&#8217;t you berhave in the minister&#8217;s house?&#8221; and,
seizing the urchin as he landed, she only ceased
shaking him as the spectacles dropped to the
floor.</p>
<p>This reception was wholly unexpected to poor
Bub, and, as she relieved him of his ministerial
vestments, he sobbed indignantly,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Bub go wite away, and never come
back no more!&#8221; and, opening the door, he
marched resolutely out.</p>
<p>The elderly caller had now the congenial duty
to do of restoring the minister&#8217;s apparel to its
proper place overhead; and, glancing out of the
window, to be sure nobody was coming, she
ascended to the missionary&#8217;s <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>.</p>
<p>Now, Rev. Mr. Payson, in his varied pursuits
of preacher, pastor, house-carpenter, stone-mason,
farmer, and doctor,&ndash;for, having skill in
medicine, the sick depended somewhat on his
medical care,&ndash;he was quite apt to leave his uninviting
study in disorder, especially when suddenly
called from home. Moreover, like the
other cabins in a new country, the house was
overrun with field mice, making it, as Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
Payson sometimes said, &#8220;dangerous to sleep with
one&#8217;s mouth open, lest a mouse might mistake it
for his hole, and pop in.&#8221; Whether, however,
such a suffocating casualty would occur or not,
the wee animals chased each other along the
logs, ransacked the closet, scampered across the
beds, nibbling at everything that tempted their
sharp little teeth; even the clergyman&#8217;s books
and papers were mutilated by them most irreverently.</p>
<p>The sight of the sheets and bits of writing
paper, the news journals, and old reviews,&ndash;for
the missionary, unable to take the current
publications, read and re-read the old ones with
a mournful satisfaction,&ndash;and the other signs of
confusion which prevailed, and which so annoyed
his wife, were as refreshing to Mrs. Smith&#8217;s eyes
as the first glimpse of land to Columbus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zactly as I expected,&#8221; she ejaculated, lifting
her hands in horror. &#8220;I alluz hearn tell that
these ere lit&#8217;ry women are a shiftless set. I
should think it would worry a man&#8217;s life out of
his body to be jined to sich a hussy. Why,
there&#8217;s my Betsy Ann; she ken go a visitin&#8217;
more &#8217;n half the time, and her husband never
said boo agin her house-work; an&#8217; I&#8217;ve known
lots o&#8217; women what could embroider, an&#8217; play the
piana, an&#8217; make heaps o&#8217; calls, an&#8217; attind balls
an&#8217; sich till enymost mornin&#8217;, an&#8217; they&#8217;d no more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
think o&#8217; wastin&#8217; their time in writin&#8217; a book than
cuttin&#8217; their heads off! But duzzn&#8217;t them books
look pooty on them shelves? I should think it
would make the minister&#8217;s head split if he knows
all that&#8217;s in them volums; an&#8217; they do say he&#8217;s
ter&#8217;ble larned. Well, I mustn&#8217;t stay here no
longer, though it&#8217;s jist as I expected.&#8221; And, returning
to the room below, she lifted her hands again
in astonishment as she saw by the clock that it
was five. &#8220;I guess John&#8217;ll have to git his own
fodder to-night, or go without. He&#8217;s used to it,
though. I brings my man up not to expect a
woman to drudge, drudge, about house. But,
mercy me!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;where&#8217;s that child
gone to? I warrant he&#8217;s in some mischief;&#8221; and,
opening the door, she called,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bub, Bub! come inter the huss!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bub did not answer. So she went around
the cabin, but could see nothing of him, and,
thinking that he would not come because it was
she that called him, she added,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come right in now; Tom wants yer.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was only a slight clearing around the
cabin, and then came a thick growth of bushes,
and beyond, the woods on either hand, save the
path in the direction of the town. It was but a
few rods to the nearest house in the village, and
she hurried there to make inquiries, for she was
becoming anxious for the child. But the children,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
playing near by, said that Bub had not
passed that way, so, running back, she instituted
a new search in the vicinity of the cabin, calling
him as before, and receiving no answer; and, as
there was a wide cart track leading into the
woods from the cabin door, thinking it natural
for the child to stray that way, she hastened in
that direction.</p>
<p>We have said that Mr. Smith had his virtues
as well as weaknesses; and, of course, his wife
was not &#8220;<i>totally</i> depraved,&#8221; in the sense in
which that much-controverted term is <i>not</i> intended
by those who hold that man is naturally
sinful. And, as she had borne children, a motherly
solicitude was now awakened in her heart
for Bub, and she pressed anxiously down the
path, while the deepening twilight steadily increased
the gloom that lingered in the shadows
of the lofty trees. The cart track grew less
distinct as she advanced; and, as she had not
found Bub, she concluded to return and alarm
the neighbors, but found her course impeded on
every side by the thick underbrush, for she had
lost the main path. With desperate efforts she
pushed aside the strong-armed boughs, and
struck once more the cart track, as she supposed;
but, alas for her, she was mistaken. Her
head had become bewildered, and she was penetrating
into the depths of the forest. On, on she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
urged her steps, wondering that she did not come
in sight of the minister&#8217;s cabin, when, to her delight,
she heard a sound like the crying of a
child. Now a heavy load was lifted from her
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must be nearing the cabin,&#8221; thought she;
&#8220;and that&#8217;s Bub;&#8221; and she called with unusual
tenderness, &#8220;Bub, Bub! Where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She listened intently, expecting a response,
and heard again the same sound, but, strangely,
farther off. So she quickened her speed, calling
the boy with renewed vigor. Wearied at last in
her fruitless endeavors, she stopped to rest a moment,
and collect her scattered faculties. She
was an apt calculator in money matters, and that
faculty, summoned into exercise now, convinced
her that she had passed over many times the distance
needed, had she been going in the right
direction; and the horrible conclusion that she
was lost in the woods thrilled her with terror.
She recollected also that there had been stories
told of late of a panther&#8217;s voice being heard in
those woods, and that it sounded like the crying
of a child. This increased her fear.</p>
<p>While she was considering what to do in her
extremity, a short, quick bark, far in the forest
behind her, succeeded by a prolonged howl, the
bloodthirsty cry of the &#8220;timber wolf,&#8221;&ndash;which,
when once heard, can never be forgotten,&ndash;broke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
on her ear. She had lived too long in the wilderness
not to know what that meant, and she
fled with wondrous swiftness down the path, on,
on, she knew not whither. Her trembling limbs
began to fail; but again the fiendish wolf-cry resounded,
succeeded by that of another, and yet
another,&ndash;showing that the call of the first had
brought others to the chase,&ndash;made her forget
her weakness, and, like a spirit, away she sped,
once more, on the race for life. The race, however,
was an unequal one, and its fearful termination
was soon staring her in the face, as she heard
the ferocious creatures drawing near; when, to
her relief, she saw ahead a small, untenanted
cabin. It was a shanty used by the woodsmen
in the winter while felling trees. The door was
off its hinges; and, passing swiftly in, in the
agony of despair, she glanced around for a hiding-place.
But the room was equally open to
the wolves as to herself. Instantly, in a manner
that seemed almost superhuman, she passed up
the side of the cabin to a beam laid for an upper
floor, and stood there, clinging, with her bony
fingers to the wall, as motionless as a marble
statue, while the wolves, disappointed of their
prey, sat on the floor below, lapping their hungry
jaws, and watching her till dawn, where she
was found by a party who had been searching
for her all night. She was speechless when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
rescued, and utterly unable for a time to give any
account of herself. Her first inquiry, however,
when she could remember what had happened,
was for little Bub.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; said one of the men, soothingly,
&#8220;he has turned up all right afore now.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as she insisted on going to the minister&#8217;s
to ascertain if Bub was safe, they assisted her
there, where were assembled a number of women,
among whom was Mrs. Jones, anxious about the
lost child, for no trace of him had been discovered.</p>
<p>When Bub was so unceremoniously disrobed
of his priestly garments by Mrs. Smith&#8217;s skinny
hand, highly offended at so gross an invasion of
his rights and dignities, to console himself he
determined to run home and tell his mother of the
outrage.</p>
<p>Now the &#8220;make of the land,&#8221; back of the
missionary&#8217;s cabin, was much like that near his
father&#8217;s, and therefore he took his way in that
direction, instead of the one Mrs. Smith had surmised.
He had taken quite a walk when he saw
the stream that divided the minister&#8217;s lot. Remembering
that there was a river back of his
mother&#8217;s cabin, he concluded that his home was
on the other side of the stream before him. The
cornstalks, too, left standing in the cleared
ground opposite, were in sight, and they resembled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
the corn that Tom had cut and stacked.
So he trudged up and down the bank to find a
way to cross, till he came to a tree which had
been felled for that purpose, and constituted the
only bridge, the topmost boughs of which rested
on the other side, just as the stream was bridged
below his father&#8217;s cabin, but upon which he had
often been charged not to venture. Bub had
been so often charged on this point, and impressed
with the danger, that he did not forget
it now; and, while he amused himself with dropping
sticks into the water, and watching to see
them carried along by the current, he called,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, come, get Bub, if you don&#8217;t want
him drownded up.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, as his mother did not make her appearance,
he shouted for Sarah, till, as it was getting
dusk, he felt afraid to linger longer, and mounted
the tree. It was a dizzy height above the water,
and Bub&#8217;s curly pate would whirl whenever he
glanced below; so, as he could not walk steadily,
he sat down, and tried to hitch along as he had
seen Sarah do. This was not much better for
him, and he began creeping on all fours; and,
with many an admonitory slip, which served to
make him the more careful, he had got nearly
across, when he fell, holding his breath from
fright. Fortunately, however, he had reached
the lower limbs, and the friendly branches held
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
him until he was able to regain the trunk of the
tree; and ere long his little feet pressed <i>terra
firma</i>.</p>
<p>The cultivated ground was not fenced next the
river, the bank being sufficiently steep to keep
out stray cattle, and Bub found some difficulty in
scaling it; but as he was hungry for supper, and
had something of a will of his own, despite his
short legs and frequent tumbles, at last he succeeded.
And, wandering around in the cornfield,
vainly seeking his mother&#8217;s cabin, baffled
in his efforts, and finding that crying was of no
avail, tired, frightened, and dispirited, he leaned
his head against a clump of cornstalks, and,
falling gently from the support to the soft soil,
he dropped asleep as the darkness came on.</p>
<p>But where was Tom? When he returned from
doing the errands, he was surprised at not finding
either Mrs. Smith or Bub at the minister&#8217;s,
and was standing undecided what to do, when
the clergyman drove up. Tom immediately
stated his perplexity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose the woman went home,
leaving Bub here alone, and the child has
strayed away?&#8221; suggested Mrs. Payson, apprehensively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I scarcely think a woman of her age would
be so imprudent,&#8221; replied her husband. &#8220;She
may, however, have gone to the village, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
taken the child with her for safe keeping. It
would be well, Tom, to go down and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom was hurrying along, when a lad called
out,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the old woman find Bub?&#8221; and he related
how she came there in search of him. This
startled Tom, and, hastening back, he told Mr.
Payson what he had heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, then,&#8221; said the minister, &#8220;the old
lady got tired of waiting for me, and took Bub
home with her. You may take the team and
ride over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finding that Mr. Smith had not seen his wife,
Tom at once concluded that there must be something
seriously wrong; and he said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told at the village that your wife was
there, trying to find Bub. It may be they are
both lost in the woods. Now, if you will get the
settlers about here together, I will rouse the villagers,
and we will make a search.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have already described the finding of the
lost woman.</p>
<p>The ground on the side of the river next to the
minister&#8217;s cabin had been looked over repeatedly,
and no one seemed to think it possible that the
child had crossed the river, and the conclusion
came to be general that he had either been carried
off by a wild beast, or fallen into the water,
and been drowned; and preparations were made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
for dragging the stream for the body, when one
of the party saw a bit of cloth, which Tom
recognized as torn from Bub&#8217;s dress, flaunting
from a twig on the tree-bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be on the other side!&#8221; cried Tom;
and, with new hope, the party rushed to explore
the field, shouting his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I be!&#8221; answered a childish voice; and
they found him seated on the ground, composedly
picking the kernels from an ear of corn, the
channels which the tears had ploughed on his
unwashed cheeks being the only evidence of the
sorrows through which he had passed; and he
said, with the air of one whose feelings had been
wounded by undeserved neglect,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hasn&#8217;t had any dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some theologians tell us that the sinful should
never be addressed through their fears; that
love can only reform the erring. Perhaps Mrs.
Smith was unlike the rest of the race; but the
terrors of that night wrought a change in her;
and Mr. Payson was surprised one day by Mr.
Smith&#8217;s calling at his cabin with a fine quarter
of beef, saying, as he lugged it in,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been killing an ox, elder; and wife
thought, if you wouldn&#8217;t be offended, that I&#8217;d
better bring you down a piece;&#8221; adding, as
he rose to go, &#8220;Here&#8217;s that due-bill that you
gave me for the improvements on the ten acres.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
Wife says you&#8217;ve paid enough on it; so I&#8217;ve receipted
it, and will call it square, if you will.
And, by the way, when you are out of butter,
just send over to our house; we can spare you
a few pounds, now and then, just as well as
not.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>FIRE AND FLOOD.</h3>
</div>
<p>The sum which had been pledged by the settlers
was not sufficient for the support of the missionary&#8217;s
family; and although the treasurer exerted
himself to the utmost, he could only collect
a portion of what was due from those whose
names were on the subscription paper. No one
felt the inconvenience of this more than the clergyman&#8217;s
wife. She was a good manager, and
had a wonderful faculty for making &#8220;one dollar
go as far as three, and getting up meals out
of nothing,&#8221; as her husband often remarked.
But it must be confessed, that with the keen
appetites brought to them on the wings of the
prairie winds, the little household sometimes
rose from the scantily-furnished table hungry
for more.</p>
<p>Mr. Payson, under these circumstances, would
comfort her with anticipations of future abundance.
They knew, indeed, that most of the settlers
had newly arrived, and had everything to
buy, as they had not been long enough settled to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
raise anything from the ground. But a year had
now elapsed, and many acres of the rich soil had
been turned over and planted, and there was
prospect of abundant returns. The missionary,
being unaccustomed to farming, and wishing to
devote his energies, as far as practicable, to the
spiritual interests of his growing charge, had let
out his tillable ten-acre lot to a neighbor, to be
cultivated on shares, reserving a little spot for
himself, which he had planted to early potatoes,
and a good variety of garden vegetables. As the
one who carried on the rest of the piece was an
intelligent and experienced farmer, and had facilities
for the work in the way of teams and men,
the clergyman felt that he might reasonably calculate
on a supply of corn and wheat, to which
crops the ground had been devoted. And nowhere
was there promise of a larger yield than
on that quick and productive river bottom. The
corn grew to a prodigious height, crowded with
mammoth ears, and the wheat emulated the corn;
while the squash and pumpkin vines conducted
as if on a race to see which would beat in the
number and size of their fruit; and Mr. Payson&#8217;s
pet sorghum&ndash;a species of sugar-cane&ndash;shot
up to a marvellous perfection. It is true that a
neighbor&#8217;s unruly cattle had broken into the enclosure
a number of times; and a contrary sow,
with her lively family of eleven, had also made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
sundry plundering raids, causing the minister
considerable trouble in driving and keeping out
the intruders; but he had already a fine supply
of seasoned oak rails under way for perfecting
the fences; and he cheerily said to his wife,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another year, and I&#8217;ll defy the unruliest animals
in the settlement to steal an ear of corn or a
potato from my lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Summer had now faded into late autumn,
and one day the farmer, who had charge of
the field, called at Mr. Payson&#8217;s, looking very
dejected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elder,&#8221; said he, &#8220;our farming this year is
going to be losing business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked the clergyman.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;most of the settlers,
like myself, came from a warmer climate than
this. We were told also that the growing season
was as long here as there, and brought our
choicest seed with us. But there is not time for
it to ripen; and our corn will not do to grind, nor
will it keep, it is so green. It is a great disappointment
to me; but most of the neighbors are
in the same situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Words cannot describe what sad tidings these
were to the missionary.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wheat is good&ndash;is it not?&#8221; he inquired.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but you know there was little sown, as
the ground was best adapted to corn.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it turned out that more was realized from
the half acre cultivated by the missionary, notwithstanding
the old farmer laughed at his city
style of doing things, than from the nine and a
half acres besides. And the year of plenty had
to be deferred for another twelvemonth.</p>
<p>That eighty acres!&ndash;how much comfort the
missionary and his wife took in the thought that
it was, or rather soon would be, theirs! How
many times they admired its pleasant, rolling aspect,
and weighed its prospective value! And
the pretty grove near the cabin, with its straight-growing
trees&ndash;what cosy walks they had with
the children in its leafy shade! What enjoyment
in noting the progress made in clearing out the
underbrush and trimming the trees of superfluous
branches!</p>
<p>&#8220;If the place was only paid for,&#8221; said the husband
one day, &#8220;I should be glad. Let me see.
Eighty acres, at one dollar and twenty-five cents
an acre,&ndash;the government price,&ndash;would be one
hundred dollars. I think I&#8217;ll act upon Mr.
Jones&#8217;s suggestion, and sell some of the timber
across the river, and pre-empt immediately. I
have been offered thirty dollars an acre for the
privilege of cutting off the wood, and, at that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
rate, three and a half acres would be more than
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the sale was effected, and, with the hundred
dollars in his pocket, the clergyman started
one morning on horseback for the Land Office,
thirty-seven miles distant. A horseback ride
across a Minnesota prairie is highly exhilarating,
and both horse and rider were in good spirits.
Seemingly half borne on by a sweeping prairie
wind, Mr. Payson reached his destination in
some five hours, in season for an early tea; and
the next morning he was conducted to the Land
Office by a lawyer acquaintance, and, with a
witness at hand to prove what he affirmed, stated,
under oath, that he had, on the land he wished to
pre-empt, a cabin and other improvements to the
amount that the law required; and then, having
paid his hundred dollars, he started towards
home with a light heart.</p>
<p>The day became dark and cloudy; and, as
there was only a faint cart track across the prairies,
the minister found, in the course of the
afternoon, that he had lost his way. There were
no cabins at which he could retrieve his error,
and, after many vain endeavors to find the track,
he let his horse take his own course; and, carrying
his master under low-branched trees and
through thorny thickets, across a swamp, he
brought him out at last by a much shorter route
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
than he had taken in going, on the farther bank
of the river, near the town.</p>
<p>As the clergyman neared the village, he noticed
heavy volumes of smoke ascending. Then
he saw Mr. Palmer with a force of men busily
engaged in checking a fire that was careering
through the bushes. There was a wall of flame
between him and them. Striking the road, he
dashed through the glowing boundary; and Mr.
Palmer, beckoning to him, said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have rather bad news to tell you, though
not so bad as it might have been. A fire commenced
near your place yesterday afternoon, and
came near burning the town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fire there!&#8221; ejaculated the minister. &#8220;How
did it start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot stop to tell you,&#8221; said his bachelor
friend; &#8220;but your wife, when you get home,
will tell you all about it. Had it not been for
her, we should have been swept away.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a sight met the clergyman&#8217;s eye as he
came into the town! The entire area, before so
like a lawn, looked as if the contents of a large
ink-pot had been spread over it. He was relieved,
however, to see that his cabin and the
other houses were still standing; but his wife
met him with a depressed bearing quite in contrast
to her usual sprightly manner. It so struck
to his heart to see how badly she felt, that&ndash;although
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
his glance from the saddle showed that
the flames had not spared his beloved grove, and
had consumed the rails, of which he had been so
proud, and spoiled many a promising tree&ndash;with
a desperate endeavor, he set about comforting
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, this is nothing,&#8221; said he&ndash;&#8220;nothing at
all! Consider what it would have been had the
cabin taken fire, and you and the children been
in danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which would have been the case,&#8221; she added,
&#8220;had not our quick-moving town owner, Mr.
Caswell, come to the rescue with his usual energy,
at the head of a force of men and teams,
bringing with them hogsheads of water, and
pails, with which to throw it upon the fire. You
have reason to thank them; for they worked as I
never saw men work before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did the fire commence?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you see,&#8221; said she, &#8220;after you left, I
said to the children, &#8216;Father&#8217;s gone to the Land
Office to buy the land; and now we&#8217;ll stir around,
and see how nice we can make everything look
by the time he gets back.&#8217; Well, you know how
unsightly the chips looked around the house, and
which you had not had time to remove. So we
went to work raking them up into little heaps.
While we were thus employed, we heard the report
of a gun in the bushes near by. The morning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
you recollect, was quite calm; but just as
the gun was fired, a gust of wind swept over the
place, carrying with it some burning wadding
that alighted in a dry log some rods away.
Before I could get there, the inflammable wood
was afire, and from that other sparks had been
borne on, and at once had kindled flames in a
number of different places. Seeing that it was
impossible to arrest the progress of the conflagration,
I sent Helen to the nearest neighbor&#8217;s to
give the alarm, and, as I have already said, by
the help of those that came, our cabin was barely
saved, and the neighbors had to fight hard to
preserve their own dwellings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each day after that the missionary would walk
about his blackened domain, pondering the uncertainty
of all sublunary things, about which he
had so often preached, his wife scrutinizing his
disconsolate face the while, and he repeating,
with an emphasis that showed he was saying it
for his own benefit as much as hers,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, it&#8217;s nothing at all&ndash;nothing at all; and as
for those few rails,&#8221;&ndash;as he kicked over the burnt
fragments with a melancholy look,&ndash;&#8220;they&#8217;re
not of much account, for the piece over the river
is pretty well fenced, after all; luckily, the fires
didn&#8217;t touch them, and we have them safe for
another year.&#8221;</p>
<p>One afternoon, a few days later, as Mr. Payson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
was in his attic study absorbed, an unwonted
darkness fell upon the page before him; then a
heavy peal of thunder succeeded. It was one
long, continuous roll, for an hour or more, without
pause, and the rain poured down as he never
saw it in any shower east; it seemed as if the
heavy clouds were literally emptying their contents
upon prairie and forest, while flash followed
flash of vivid lightning. Throughout the whole
night it rained, and the next day, and the next;
and, were it not for the ancient promise, one
might have thought that a second flood was to
sweep the inhabitants of the world away. About
midnight of the third day of the terrible storm,
the family at the missionary&#8217;s cabin were awakened
by wild shoutings in the village below.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose is the matter?&#8221; asked
Mrs. Payson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing serious, I think,&#8221; said her husband.
&#8220;As the town site is rolling and descends towards
the river, it is probable that the high water has
come up into some of the yards and gardens, and
perhaps has invaded some of the settlers&#8217; pig-pens
and hen-coops, and the neighbors are working in
the rain and darkness to save their live stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun came out next morning like &#8220;a bride-groom
from out his chamber, rejoicing as a strong
man to run his race,&#8221; flooding the fields with
light, as the clouds had flooded them with water,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
revealing the destruction which the tempest had
caused. It appeared that the river, a short distance
up stream from the town, had become obstructed
by dead trees, and brush, and loosened
soil, until a heavy body of water had accumulated,
when, the impediment suddenly giving
way, the water rushed with tremendous power,
inundating a wide extent of ground, and sweeping
away everything movable in its path. Many
cabins were flooded, sleepers being awakened by
the water dashing against their beds, while articles
of furniture were floating about in the room.
It was this that caused the outcries that Mr. Payson
had heard.</p>
<p>The Jones&#8217;s cabin had been well chosen for
safety on ordinary occasions; but, on the night
in question, Tom was awakened by something
cold touching his hand; for, in throwing it out of
bed in his sleep, it had been immersed in the
water, which had entered the room, and was rapidly
rising. Shouting to his mother and the children,
he struck a light, and leaped into the
water; and, taking Bub in his arms, and directing
the movements of the rest, he hurried them
out of the door, away from the river bank, as fast
as they could go. How providential it was that
he should have, in his restlessness, dropped his
hand over the bedside! for scarcely had they ascended
a swell of ground beyond the field when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
the cabin went down with a crash, and the fragments,
whirling about and jarring together, disappeared
from view.</p>
<p>They were now poorer than ever; but, cold
and wet, with the lightning flashing about them,
in the pouring rain, they clung together for mutual
protection, while they took their toilsome and
difficult way from the scene of danger.</p>
<p>There was an unoccupied shanty in the edge
of the town farthest from the river, and to that
Tom led the terrified and shivering group. It
was three full hours before they reached it; and
then they had nothing but the bare walls and
the bare floor, with the shelter over their heads,
for a resting-place, where, the next day, the missionary
found them as he went about assisting
to succor the sufferers; and, at his suggestion,
from the scanty stores of the settlers about,
their cabin was fitted out with eatables and
housekeeping articles.</p>
<p>During all this time Mr. Payson had been so
occupied in benevolent labor among those whose
cabins had been flooded, that it had not occurred
to him that he had sustained any damage; but,
after the subsiding of the waters, as he took his
way down his favorite path through the grove,
he saw that the waters had borne away every
vestige of fencing around his cherished ten-acre
lot. The highest part of the fence had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
been under water many feet on that calamitous
night, and with the loss of the rails had gone
down another of the earthly props on which
he had leaned for his daily bread in the wilderness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>THE INDIAN LODGE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Spring on a north-western prairie. What a
glorious scene! Suddenly, you scarcely know
when, the snow has disappeared, leaving the
long, dead grass lying in matted unsightliness,
and you would think it was dead forever; but
soon, in little clusters of from three to seven,
you see dotting the landscape a purple flower, a
tough, membranous, hairy sheath protecting each
floweret from the chilling winds, for it opens at
once to your gaze. Then, as the weather waxes
genial, the blossoms shoot up from their hirsute
guardianship, and nod brightly in the breeze.
It is the &#8220;spring beauty,&#8221;&ndash;as the frontier folk
call it,&ndash;the first vegetation of the season, presenting
the phenomenon of rich blooming flowers,
while yet the lifeless turf shows no signs of
vitality. But life is there; for at once, as if by
magic, the whole expanse is green with verdure,
growing with marvellous rapidity, decked with
flowers.</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Garden without path or fence,<br />
Rolling up its billowy blooms.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>Then you rise some soft morning, and the air
is vocal with the cooing of myriad birds. If you
are just from the east, you will think that thousands
of turtle doves are announcing that spring
has come. They seem close about you; but you
cannot see them. They are not in the groves
near by; you follow the sounds through the waving
prairie grass for a long distance, and you
find them not, and will be surprised when your
western friend tells you that these are the voices
of the prairie hens, miles away, holding their
annual convention, the queer cuckooing not being
loving sounds, but notes of war&ndash;abortive
attempts at crowing, which the rival males set
up as they prepare to do battle with each other.</p>
<p>And now from the blue expanse overhead
come down the varied cries of the migratory
birds returning from the south. Line upon line
of wild geese, in military order, follow their
leader, while the trumpet blasts of the sand-hill
cranes&ndash;the ostrich of the American prairie&ndash;ring
out clear and shrill, and their long white
bills glisten in the sunlight from afar, like bristling
bayonets of ivory.</p>
<p>Tom stood in front of the hotel, enjoying the
spring sights and sounds with unusual zest. The
two winters now past had been eventful to him.
Mr. Payson, the missionary, who had taken a
great interest in Tom, had, the winter before,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
kept school in his own cabin; and Tom and his
sister Eliza had attended much of the time, their
tuition being paid by such assistance as Tom
might be able to render Mr. Payson in his outdoor
work.</p>
<p>Eliza had grown to be a sedate and interesting
young woman, and was making good headway
with her studies, when one day she gave notice
that she should not be able to attend school any
longer; and to her teacher&#8217;s inquiries she returned
only blushes in reply, and he could get no further
light until the next day, when an enterprising
young man from a &#8220;neighboring village,&#8221; twenty
miles distant, called to invite Mr. Payson to join
himself and &#8220;Miss Eliza&#8221; in marriage.</p>
<p>The last winter the missionary&#8217;s family had
occupied rooms at the hotel. Mrs. Payson had
been growingly unhappy from dread of the Indians,
and often said to her husband,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our lot is just such a place as they would be
likely to come to first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Payson did not share this fear; but, on
account of her feelings, the generous-hearted
landlord offered them rooms for the winter rent
free.</p>
<p>The winter had gone by without any adverse
occurrence. Tom had been prospering in his
studies under the missionary&#8217;s direction, working
for his board in the family of one of the town
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
owners, just opposite the hotel; so it was but a
step for him to the missionary&#8217;s when he wished
to recite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be able to hear my recitation this
afternoon?&#8221; asked Tom, as Mr. Payson came
down the hotel steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the missionary. &#8220;I am called
away this morning, but I think I shall get back
in season.&#8221;</p>
<p>That afternoon, as Tom sat in the missionary&#8217;s
front room, absorbed in a book, the furious barking
of a dog disturbed him. He glanced out of
the window, and saw, to his surprise, an Indian.
The savage had turned, facing the hotel, rifle in
his hand, and, with flashing eyes, was driving
back a large mastiff that had attacked him. Tom
was struck with the singular intelligence and
beauty of the young savage. He was a shade
lighter than most of his race, had large, dark,
expressive eyes, regular and finely-cut features,
a symmetric form, and his luxuriant black hair,
which was of great length, was dressed with
most elaborate care, and the ornaments that he
wore about his person, and his blanket, were
better than those usually worn by Indians.</p>
<p>From the Indian&#8217;s manner, Tom concluded
that he suspected the dog was set upon him by
some white person. The bearing of the red man
was lofty, collected, and defiant. In an instant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
Tom sprang down the front stairs, and called the
dog off. The Indian, glancing at the lad, went
stolidly on his way, up the main street, through
the village, till he was hidden from view by the
trees on the missionary&#8217;s land.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payson and her children stood at the
window, watching the retreating figure of the
Indian with mingled fear and admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he handsome?&#8221; exclaimed the elder of
the little girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly is very intelligent looking,&#8221; remarked
her mother; &#8220;a noble specimen of the
red man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see that Indian?&#8221; inquired the landlady,
a calm, dignified woman, as she stepped
into the room. &#8220;One of the boarders says there
is quite a company of them encamped on your
husbands land. The have a large wigwam,
and seem to be making themselves as much at
home as if they owned the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>The missionary&#8217;s wife shuddered, and remarked,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just as I foreboded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But these are <i>friendly</i>,&#8221; returned the landlady.
&#8220;The chief has a letter from the government
agent, recommending him to the confidence
and charity of the settlers. It has been
a long and hard winter, and the agent says there
has been much suffering among the Indians.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is that young Indian the chief?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Payson.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I wish he were. He is the finest-looking
savage I ever saw. I don&#8217;t think I should be
afraid to trust him. But the chief looks frightfully;
he is as cruel and treacherous as a snake,
or I do not read his face aright.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have seen him?&#8221; said the other, in
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I was riding through the woods with
husband, and we met him. The young Indian
seems to belong to the company, and yet holds
himself somewhat aloof from the others, as if he
feels conscious of being superior to them, and
finds it difficult to fellowship their low ways.
To-morrow a party of us are going to call on the
Indians at their wigwam, and I stepped in to invite
you to go. There will be a good many of
us; so you needn&#8217;t fear being tomahawked!&#8221; she
added, laughing.</p>
<p>The visit to the Indians the next day was full
of interest to the missionary&#8217;s family, for, although
they had seen numbers of the half-civilized Indians
of the Eastern States, they had never before
seen the red man in his native wilds, with habits
and customs unchanged from their primitive
character. The wigwam was large and well
constructed, erected in a sheltered and romantic
spot, convenient at once to the village, the woods,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
and the river. Within were squatted four or
five of the company on the ground, playing a
game of chance, in which employment the Indian
men spend most of their time, when not hunting,
fishing, or at war. There were no women with
them, and therefore the men had, besides the cooking,
to do the drudgery usually assigned to the
squaws, such as gathering and bringing in the
wood, and dressing the skins of the wild animals.</p>
<p>The Indians did not lift their eyes as the
whites entered through the narrow opening which
served as door, and ranged themselves around
the sides of the lodge as best they might. Nor
did they answer any questions, not appearing
to understand a word of English, their faces
remaining as stolid under the remarks of the
whites as if nothing had been said; and taking
it for granted that the Indians were as ignorant
of civilized speech as they appeared, some of
the inquisitive pale-faces indulged themselves in
quite uncivilized speeches, for they had a traditional
contempt and hatred of their tawny
brothers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better not express yourself quite so
freely,&#8221; said Mr. Caswell, the landlord, aside to
a settler; &#8220;these fellows understand every word
you say, and it&#8217;s better to have the good will
than the ill will of a dog, as the old saying is.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>Curious, however, to see what the effect would
be, those who disliked the Indians the most made
them presents with the rest. Tobacco, skeins
of cotton, brass buttons, cakes, crackers, cents,
sticks of candy, bits of ribbon, were received by
the Indians without a word or nod of acknowledgment.
No sign of consciousness of visitor
or presents was evinced, save that a grimy
hand would deftly clutch the article tossed within
its reach, and convey it to the head, quickly and
ingeniously twisting it in the hair, the game proceeding
the while, without a pause. The young
Indian played with his companions; and from
his beauty and princely bearing drew much attention
and a large share of the gifts to himself;
yet even in receiving the presents he seemed
different from the other savages. His was the
only face in the swarthy group that betrayed
&#8220;the workings of the soul;&#8221; and although he
fastened the trinkets in his raven locks, drops
of sweat stood on his brow, and it seemed as if
it cost him a struggle to be treated as an object
of charity.</p>
<p>Tom, with the others, was much struck with
the appearance of the young Indian, and made
a number of unsuccessful attempts to converse
with him. Finding that the &#8220;confusion of
tongues,&#8221; or some other barrier, had made talking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
together impossible, in various ingenious
ways he tried to direct the Indian&#8217;s attention to
himself, but without avail; game succeeded
game in Indian silence, the talking and advancing
towards acquaintanceship remaining wholly
on the side of the whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many belong to this company?&#8221; asked
Mr. Payson of the landlord.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are nine of them: the rest are out
hunting, I suppose,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;And do all these chaps manage to sleep in
this little hut?&#8221; asked a settler.</p>
<p>&#8220;A nice time they must have of it on the
ground, especially when it rains,&#8221; added another,
pointing up through the roof, which was open,
to let out the smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the missionary, &#8220;everything is in
remarkable order here. Don&#8217;t you see that each
man has his place, and on the side of the lodge
a snug chance to stow away or hang up his personal
effects. We whites could scarcely arrange
the little space with more fairness and mathematical
precision, so as to make the most of the
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was indeed so; and much did the callers
marvel at the intelligent system that prevailed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one has had a hand in the ordering
of affairs here, who has more intellect than we
are accustomed to attribute to the red man;&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
the minister glanced at the young Indian, as if
to say, &#8220;It must be due to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>But twilight was falling, and the villagers
started on their way home. Scarcely, however,
had they passed the hedge of elders and the
rows of young oaks that hid the abode of the
Indians from view, when from within the wigwam
there went up a startling whoop and yell,
mingled with derisive laughter.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payson stood still, pale with terror, as if
expecting to see the savages rush out to massacre
them. But they kept within their tent, their
horrible whoopings and mockings continuing
until the whites were well away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not like the sound of those yells,&#8221; said
the missionary, soberly.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, the Indians are only amusing themselves
by trying to scare the women and children,&#8221; replied
Mr. Caswell, merrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is more than that intended,&#8221; returned
the minister. &#8220;There was the bitterest irony and
hatred expressed in those tones. If the authors
of them dared, or it was in their plan to do so
now, they would spring upon us with the eagerness
of so many beasts of prey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day eight of the Indians walked into
the village, one after the other, as is the Indian
way, and called at the hotel to beg. They had
found their tongues over night, and could manage,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
not only to understand, when it was for
their interest, what was said to them, but in
broken English make reply. They were a fine
set of men, physically&ndash;tall, broad-chested,
erect; and, wrapped in their white and red blankets,
they made a formidable appearance. There
was no touch of fawning or crouching in their
manner. They demanded the articles given them,
rather than begged. You would have thought
them lords of the soil, come to collect rent of
tardy tenantry.</p>
<p>The young Indian, however, still preserved
his individuality, and various romantic conjectures
were conjured up in imaginative heads concerning
him. Some went so far as to assert that he
had no Indian blood in him, and started the
theory that he must have had white parentage,
and that he might have been stolen, when a
child, from some noble white family. But the
more experienced of the pioneers set that at rest
by affirming that they could tell the pure, unmixed
Indian, and that he was one.</p>
<p>Tom lingered much about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;O,&#8221; said he to the missionary, &#8220;if I could
only talk with him, how I would love to teach
him how to read, and speak to him of the blessed
things in the Bible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is on my mind most of the time, Tom,&#8221;
replied the good man. &#8220;I am often asking myself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
Can I not, in some way, lead these benighted
souls to the Lamb of God? But how
inaccessible they are! What an impassable barrier
between them and us! and, with the exception
of the youngest of them, how brutal
and low! To see such splendidly-formed men
spend their time squatted on the earth, playing
jack-straws, or some equally silly game, from
morning to night, is pitiful. And then their
yelling and laughter are more like wild beasts
or demons than human beings. These people
seem to me the lowest, meanest, most treacherous,
and hardened of the human race. I do not
wonder that it is so difficult to civilize or Christianize
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weeks went by, and the Indians remained in
their lodge, daily growing bolder and more intrusive,
till they had become obnoxious to the
most benevolent of the settlers. It had come to
be not over pleasant to the women of the neighborhood
to look up from their domestic duties,
and see that a grim savage had stolen into the
house, and, unasked, seated himself in a chair,
ready, as soon as he thought best, to nod, in a
dictatorial way, towards some coveted article, in
a manner which meant,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hand that to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tom and the young Indian&ndash;who,
whether that was his real Indian name or not,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
was called <i>Long Hair</i>&ndash;had become quite intimate.
Nevertheless, not many words passed
between them, for Long Hair was more reticent,
if possible, than the rest of his company. But
without word-signs they managed to understand
each other. Long Hair, indeed, appeared to
read Tom&#8217;s thoughts intuitively, and Mrs. Payson
was often made anxious for Tom, because
he would be gone so long in the woods with
Long Hair. The latter had selected a tree for a
canoe, and Tom, with his sharp-edged axe, cut
it down for him, and helped him dig it out and
shape it. A strange sympathy had grown up
between them, and one evening, as Tom was on
his way to the prayer-meeting, chancing to meet
Long Hair, he invited the latter to accompany
him, trying, with great earnestness, to make him
comprehend the object of the gathering. Long
Hair seemed to gain a dim perception of what
his friend meant, and, after much persuasion,
entered with Tom the cabin in which the meeting
was to be held. The Indian&#8217;s face gave evidence
of great excitement as the services progressed;
the deep solemnity of the prayers, and
the devout strains of Christian song, took powerful
hold of the red man&#8217;s feelings. Doubtless he
understood little of the scene in which, for the
first time, he mingled; but a potent influence
went along with it, and so affected was he, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
his hand sought Tom&#8217;s, and he held it in a
strong, tender grasp till the meeting closed, his
frame trembling with emotion. And yet Tom
could not converse with him afterwards; and
what the nature of the emotion was that shook
him so,&ndash;what thoughts were stirred, and with
what result for eternity in the bosom of that silent
son of the prairie, who, for the first time, had
attended Christian worship,&ndash;no one knew.
Tom could not induce him to attend again, and
yet he did not seem offended at what he had
heard; but when his white friend alluded to it,
his eye gleamed with a new light, and his face
looked thoughtfully, doubtfully serious.</p>
<p>Nearly every day Tom and Long Hair were
together, the latter keeping but little in the wigwam,
and seldom going with the other Indians.
When they filed into town, and besieged the
houses, trying the doors, peeping into the windows,
accosting the street-passers, Long Hair
was not with them; and when at evening they
returned exultant from a successful hunt, singing
their strong-lunged song of triumph,&ndash;their
wild and scarcely human &#8220;Hi yar! hi yar!&#8221;
growing nearer, till, entering the village, they
sang their way through to their lodge, Long Hair
was not of their number.</p>
<p>One day Tom, chancing to visit the wigwam,
found Long Hair there, shivering with a violent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
attack of ague. He was alone, and had been
for two days.</p>
<p>How bare and cheerless appeared the Indian&#8217;s
life to Tom&#8217;s sympathetic nature then! for an
Indian, when sick, has few comforts. Solitary
he sits wrapped in his blanket, or lies on the
ground, with no one to nurse or care for him; no
nice dishes to tempt his feeble appetite, no hand
to bathe his fevered brow, no medicines to assuage
his pain or drive disease away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Long Hair,&#8221; cried Tom, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t
you let me know that you were sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Long Hair sat shaking in his blanket, and,
as usual, heard, but made no answer, only with
his expressive eyes.</p>
<p>Tom brought in wood, and started the fire, and
saying, &#8220;Mother&#8217;ll know just what to do for you,
Long Hair; I&#8217;ll go and tell her how you are,&#8221; he
ran to his mother&#8217;s cabin, and, quickly making
some nourishing gruel, and putting up a store of
simples that she used in fever and ague, she returned
with Tom to the lodge. What a treasure is a
loving, experienced woman in sickness, whether
in a palace, a log house, or beneath the rude
shelter of an Indian&#8217;s moving home&ndash;ever gentle,
exhaustless in resources, untiring in her ministrations!
It seemed a marvel to Tom how readily
his mother knew just what to do for Long
Hair, intuitively adapting herself to his Indian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
peculiarities; and, for the week that his illness
lasted, she nursed him with great tenderness,
often remarking to Tom,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is one of God&#8217;s children, Tom; for the
Bible says, &#8216;God has made of one blood all the
nations of men to dwell upon the face of the
earth,&#8217; and Jesus died for the red man as much as
for the white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through all this womanly care of him by Mrs.
Jones, and brotherly attention of Tom, the Indian,
while shivering with the chill, or burning
and panting with the fever, made no acknowledgments
of kindness shown him, or uttered a
word of complaint as he suffered, and, when he
recovered, returned in silence to his Indian occupations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t give one of the red skins a glass
of water to save his life!&#8221; exclaimed a settler
who had lost by the depredations of the Indians.
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a particle of gratitude in one of
&#8216;em. Give any of them all you have, and ten
to one he&#8217;ll steal upon you out of a bush, and
take your scalp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too true of most of the Indians, I admit,&#8221;
said Mrs. Jones, &#8220;and perhaps Long Hair
will prove ungrateful; but I only did as the
Bible directs, and I am contented.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, some days after, as Long Hair strode
into her cabin with a freshly-killed deer on his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
shoulder, which he deposited at her feet, saying,
as he left,&ndash;for he tarried not to sit down,&ndash;&#8220;White
squaw, much good; Long Hair bring venison,&#8221;
Mrs. Jones wiped the tears from her eyes,
rejoicing more to find that there was gratitude
even in an Indian&#8217;s heart, than at receiving his
generous gift.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>THE WAR-SONG.</h3>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Payson sat sewing in her pleasant room
at the hotel. Her thoughts were far away from
the checkered experiences of the frontier, for
her husband&ndash;having received by the last mail
a new book from an eastern friend&ndash;read while
she plied her needle. Baby was in his crib in the
bed-room adjoining, and Fannie and Helen were
whispering in a matronly way in the corner, as
with the help of mother&#8217;s scissors they fitted their
dolls to new dresses. Had you looked in upon
the group, you would not realize that they constituted
a pioneer missionary&#8217;s family; for the hotel
building was tasteful and spacious, and if they
lived and dressed plainly, and often felt the pinchings
of poverty, their appearance betrayed no
unhappiness. And then the volume had transported
the father and mother to other and brighter
scenes than those of the uncultured wilderness.
The tone of the reader in its subdued or impassioned
modulations attested the interest he
felt in the volume, and the heightened color of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
the wife showed her sympathy with the theme.
What a magician is a book! It can cause the
poor to forget their poverty, and the wanderer in
a distant land to become oblivious of his exile.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; exclaimed the missionary
and his wife at once, as they sprang to their feet
in breathless suspense.</p>
<p>Again the horrible cry broke forth, seeming to
come from the room below.</p>
<p>At this moment the fair face of the landlady
appeared, and she said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indians are below, and are going to sing
for us. Won&#8217;t you come down and hear them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather discordant music,&#8221; answered the minister;
&#8220;but I think we may as well accept your
invitation&ndash;don&#8217;t you, wife?&#8221; and taking the children
with them, they descended to the dining-room.
Ranged round the long table were eight
savages, and sitting back against the walls a few
boarders,&ndash;for most of the household were away.
Some of the Indians held tin pans, and on these,
as an accompaniment, they beat time with iron
instruments, their heavy blows making a deafening
din, and their harsh, guttural notes, uttered in
unison, made the diabolical uproar. Mr. Payson&#8217;s
inspection of the performers in this strange
concert was anything but satisfactory to him.
The manner of the savages was impudent and
brutal beyond anything he had yet seen in them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
and he fancied that their sneering and malignant
grimaces and serpent-like contortions of the body
expressed evil and vengeful passions that burned
within. On the faces of the whites a startled,
anxious look struggled, with an effort to feel at
ease, and fear nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something wrong about these Indians,&#8221;
whispered the minister to a man near
him; &#8220;they are plotting mischief; their looks and
tones are full of ugliness; and I am convinced
that if they intend no trouble to-night, they know
that some hidden danger threatens us. See how
that chief&#8217;s eye glares. Observe the murderous
leer of the one beside him. Notice how they
mock and insult us to our very faces. Now, how
awfully jubilant their tones, as if they had us at
their mercy. Do you suppose they are secretly
armed?&#8221; and, rising, he went calmly from Indian
to Indian, lifting the blanket of each, to see
if a rifle cut short, or some other deadly weapon,
was not concealed there. But none was to be
found; and at the close of their alarming exhibition,
the chief haughtily arose, bowed to the
missionary, who was now seated again, and passed
out; each of his followers imitating him in the
salute as he glided from the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indians have taken down their wigwam,
and gone away,&#8221; said Tom to Mr. Payson, the
next day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear it,&#8221; replied the missionary;
&#8220;they are a dangerous set, and I have been quite
anxious lest the settlers should get into a quarrel
with them. But what makes you look so depressed?
Are any of your folks sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Tom, striving to appear calm.
&#8220;Father came home last night&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that was a pleasant surprise&ndash;was it
not?&#8221; interrupted his kind friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but&ndash;but&ndash;he wants us to remove.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remove! Whereto?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Near Spirit Lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to hear that. I heard this morning
that the Sioux are quite insolent towards the settlers
in that vicinity, and threaten an outbreak.
I must see your father, and dissuade him from his
project;&#8221; and the minister proceeded to the cabin
occupied by the Joneses.</p>
<p>It was near Spirit Lake that Mr. Jones was
wounded by the Indian. This, however, did not
deter him from going there again to hunt. Three
promising young settlements had sprung up there,
side by side, for the beauty, fertility, and cheapness
of the land had attracted quite an immigration
that way. Mr. Jones had mingled much
with the settlers,&ndash;for an entirely <i>new</i> country
had special charms for him,&ndash;and his knowledge
of all matters most needful to the pioneer made
him a welcome acquaintance. He had become a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
great favorite with the inhabitants. The Indians
were numerous and bold, but entertained a wholesome
dread of the squatter&#8217;s rifle and personal
courage; and the whites, although they did not
anticipate serious trouble with the savages, felt so
much safer when he was with them, that they
offered him a comfortable cabin, and promised
other advantages if he would dwell among
them. Among the Indians Mr. Jones went by
the name of <i>Long Rifle</i>, and they expressed great
admiration of his marksmanship. Occasions not
unfrequently happened for him to show his superior
qualities in that line. For example, the
squatter happened in one day at a cabin, and
found some half dozen Indians there, who had
busied themselves, in the absence of the men, in
rummaging the house for plunder, greatly to the
terror of the women and children. As Mr. Jones
appeared, they seated themselves with Indian
gravity, refusing to answer a word, while their
faces wore an angry and sullen look. Among
these were some famous for their skill with the
rifle, and, knowing their passion for target-shooting,
he proposed at once a trial of skill. This
was eagerly accepted; but the squatter triumphed
in the contest, and the Indians went away much
impressed with the result.</p>
<p>When Mr. Jones returned to his family, and
mentioned his decision to remove, the mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
heard his account with a foreboding heart, but
made no objection, only saying,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t take Tom away from his studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this the father assented, for he really felt
grateful to the missionary for the interest he took
in his son, and proud of the progress the lad was
making in his books.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; said he, &#8220;has a good chance, and it
isn&#8217;t in me to discourage him.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was, however, more difficult to persuade Tom
to remain behind, than for his parents to give him
up,&ndash;hard as it was for them. He had so long
been the staff of his mother, that it seemed like
selfish desertion for him to stay with the missionary,
while she went farther off on the frontier.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is your <i>duty</i> to remain, Tom,&#8221; urged the
mother. &#8220;God has opened the way for you to
cultivate your mind, and fit yourself for usefulness;
and we shall not be so far away but that
you can come to us at any time, if we need you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And are you not afraid to go where there are
so many Indians?&#8221; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I am afraid; and yet I
feel strengthened to go. Your father will be
useful there. He is fitted to take the lead in case
of trouble with the savages; the settlers look up
to him, and depend upon him, and I cannot find
it in my heart to hold him back; and if he goes,
it is best for me to be with him. If you remain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
behind, we shall have in you a friend to assist
us if any trouble should arise. You might
be able to do more for us here than if shut up
with us by a common danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, with many a last farewell by the fond
mother, Tom saw them start for their new home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>THE MASSACRE AT SPIRIT LAKE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Between the settlement in which the missionary
lived and the one next north-east was a wide
prairie, succeeded by a stretch of primitive forests,
through which, down its abysmal, rocky bed,
ran a foaming river. The limestone bluffs that
formed its banks abounded in holes and caves&ndash;fitting
homes for wild beasts. Here the cry of
the panther might be heard, and bears and
wolves sought their food.</p>
<p>Through these gloomy solitudes Tom was
making his way in the buggy, which the missionary
had provided; for Tom had been intrusted
with the errand of going to the village
beyond for a trunk which had arrived from the east
for Mr. Payson. He was jogging along, listening
to the strange sounds of the forest; for it
was near here, the last winter, that a sight met his
gaze that he could never forget. There had been
a succession of those <i>still</i> snow-storms which so
often come in the night in Minnesota, and go off
at day-dawn, leaving a perfectly even coating of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
snow over everything. The sleighing was quite
passable, and the weather, that day, mild. Coming
suddenly to an open space, within a few feet
of him, were two large gray wolves, eating a
horse not yet dead. The poor beast was still attached
to his team, and hopelessly struggled
against his twofold fate; for he had fallen into
a &#8216;sink-hole&#8217; that the treacherous snow had concealed,
and his driver, unable to extricate him,
had abandoned him to his fate, or gone for help.
Brandishing his whip, Tom shouted at the
wolves in hope of frightening them off. They
only raised their heads to glare threateningly at
him, their jaws dripping blood, then voraciously
resumed their gory repast, tearing great quivering
masses of flesh from the struggling beast,
which they seemed to swallow without chewing,
with such a ravenous appetite did they eat.</p>
<p>Tom was a brave lad. But as he descended
the side of the hill towards the river, and the
dense shadows made his way dim, although it
was high noon and a brilliant sun was flooding
the prairies, he could not shake off a feeling of
dread that had grown upon him. Every now
and then he caught himself starting with nervous
apprehension, and, to break the spell, he began
to whistle a merry tune, to keep up his courage,
as boys are wont to do. But he was thinking
how dismally it sounded, when, suddenly, in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
distance rang out the clear notes of a robin.
Tom involuntarily reined in his horse at that;
for the call of that bird his Indian friend Long
Hair used to imitate for a signal, and had taught
Tom how to do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the sake of Long Hair,&#8221; said Tom,
more cheerily, &#8220;I&#8217;ll answer you, old bird.&#8221;</p>
<p>But scarcely had he done so, when, to his
surprise, the bird responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;you think I&#8217;m your mate,
I guess; and if you choose to give me your
company, I shall not object, it is so lonely
here!&#8221;</p>
<p>So he answered the robin again.</p>
<p>Instantly the bushes parted, and Long Hair
stepped into view. His eyes were bloodshot, his
blanket torn, and his whole appearance indicated
that something unusual had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Long Hair!&#8221; exclaimed Tom, greatly
startled; &#8220;what is the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian glanced warily about, then laid
his ear to the ground, listening intently, and
arose quickly, saying,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indian come. Much fight. Kill white man;
kill white squaw; kill pappoose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What of my father and mother?&#8221; inquired
Tom, excitedly. &#8220;Have they been murdered?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Long Hair save &#8217;um little; father shoot one,
two, tree, ten Injun. Long Hair been up to Fort.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
Sojer no bleeve Long Hair; say he spy. Long
Hair come for Tom to get sojer. Injun see Long
Hair; be here pretty soon&ndash;one, two, tree, ten,
twenty, <i>fifty</i>! Kill Long Hair, kill Tom, take
scalp. Tom go with Long Hair. He save him.
Horse know way home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom saw, from Long Hair&#8217;s manner, that it
was no time for delay, and, leaping from the
wagon, with marvellous quickness the Indian
turned the horse&#8217;s head about, facing home, and,
striking him smartly, the spirited animal rapidly
retraced his way.</p>
<p>At their right rose a rocky ridge to a considerable
height, springing up which Long Hair
motioned Tom to follow. The other side was
quite precipitous; but a narrow fissure in the
rock afforded a scanty footing, down which the
Indian glided, Tom following him, although
dizzy with the height. Passing along for a short
distance, they came to a scrub oak, the roots of
which had struck into the side of the ledge.
Climbing around it, a small opening appeared.
Motioning Tom to enter, Long Hair said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If both stay, Injun kill both. Long Hair
run swift like deer;&#8221; and he darted up the ridge
again with cat-like agility.</p>
<p>When Tom&#8217;s eyes became accustomed to the
darkness, he found himself in a spacious, rocky
room. It was one of those natural caves which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
seem as if the work of art, rather than a freak of
nature. The room was almost a perfect square,
and extending around its sides was a seat of solid
rock, while in a square hole, which looked as if
it had been excavated for the purpose, was a
spring, the water of which was icy cold, and of
crystal clearness.</p>
<p>Tom seated himself to await the result of the
strange events that had so suddenly befallen
him. Not a sound was to be heard in the forest;
and had he not known enough of the Indian
acuteness in detecting the approach of a concealed
or distant foe, he would have doubted
Long Hair&#8217;s representations of the impending
peril. Indeed, as the moments sped,&ndash;and they
seemed long to him,&ndash;he had begun to consider
the propriety of venturing out to look about a
little, when a slight rustle in the ravine below
arrested his attention. At any other time he
would not have noticed the sound, it was so like
the passing of the breeze. The scrawny roots
of the tree at the entrance of the cave, and the
darkness within, protected him from observation;
and, drawing nearer the mouth of the cavern,
he watched the bushes below with strained eye.
He had not long to wait when he saw an Indian
creeping cautiously along; then, a little farther
off, another came into view, and still another.
They were Long Hair&#8217;s pursuers; and from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
their belts hung a number of scalps, which, from
their bloody appearance, showed that they had
recently been taken; and the luxuriant tresses
of some of them indicated that they were from
the heads of white women. At the sight Tom&#8217;s
blood almost froze in his veins. But his heart
gave a sudden bound as he heard the sound of
soft footfalls. From this he judged that the Indians
had got upon Long Hair&#8217;s trail, and some
of them had gone round in front of the ridge,
while the others followed closely in his track.
Tom felt that his hour had come, and a mortal
terror seized him. Then, thinking of his imperilled
father and mother, to whose succor Long
Hair had bidden him go, he was astonished at
the fierce reaction which followed. He had no
weapons; so, planting himself behind the tree,
he lay in wait, ready to spring upon the first
intruder, and hurl him into the depths below.</p>
<p>The dark figure of an Indian creeping stealthily
along, like a horrid serpent, he saw cautiously
approaching the tree: a moment more,
and the death grapple would come, when an exclamation
above made the Indian turn his head.
Long Hair&#8217;s trail, returning from the cave, had
been struck by another Indian. At the same
instant, Long Hair&#8217;s defiant war-whoop, challenging
his pursuers to come on, was heard in the
distance. The answering yell of the savages
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
from the ravine below and the ridge above rang
out as they dashed after. The Indian, unaware
of the presence of Tom, stepped to the tree to
turn himself on the face of the cliff, so that he
stood with his brawny back close to Tom. His
waist also was hung with gory scalps. The
sight maddened Tom to frenzy. The savage let
go the tree, and started to join the chase, when
Tom thrust his hands at once through the fissure,
and sent him headlong from the precipice. The
body struck with a dull, heavy thud, and all was
still.</p>
<p>Tom could hear the sound of the pursuit as it
died away, and knew that there was now no immediate
danger to him; and, stooping down, he
took a long draught from the spring, and bathed
his fevered brow. Then, climbing out of his
hiding-place, he passed quickly upon the ridge,
and descended into the ravine below, where lay
the mutilated form of the red man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows but he is the murderer of some
of our family?&#8221; he said, as he drew near. &#8220;No;
none of our folks have such hair as that,&#8221; he
added, after examining the scalps, one by one.
Then, taking possession of the rifle, powder-horn,
and bullet-pouch, and thrusting the Indian&#8217;s
scalping-knife into his belt, and throwing
some limbs over the body, that it might not so
soon be discovered by his friends, Tom hurried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
away in the direction of the fort, as Long Hair
had suggested. He lingered a moment, however,
wishing that he could do something to
serve Long Hair, who, he well knew, had uttered
that challenging war-cry that saved his
life on purpose to call the Indians away from the
cave.</p>
<p>But what was he? A mere boy against so
many infuriated savages. Besides, they were
now far away, he knew not where. Moreover,
Long Hair had charged him to go for the soldiers
to rescue his father and mother, and, without
further hesitation, he turned his steps towards
the fort. Tom was in good health, a quick
walker, and, like his father, accustomed to thread
the woods and traverse the prairies.</p>
<p>Tom was agitated with strong and conflicting
emotions as he pursued his lonely way. His
boy-nature had been terribly roused by the exciting
scenes through which he had just passed.
He had experienced the strange feeling which
men feel, when, in battle, they are stirred by danger
and the sight of blood to deeds of blood.
It was under this feeling that he was led to precipitate
the Indian from the bluff, and to view his
remains with so much composure. But now a
faintness came stealing over him. His young
heart recoiled at the thought of what he had
done. This relenting, however, was repelled by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
the recollection of Long Hair&#8217;s heroism, and his
father and mother&#8217;s beleaguered condition, if, indeed,
the tomahawk ere this had not drank their
life. How many days had passed since Long
Hair had seen them he knew not; but it was
easy to see from his friend&#8217;s anxiety that his
parents were in an extremity of danger, and
whether he could succeed in procuring assistance
for them in season seemed doubtful. It would
take him, to go afoot, two days to reach the fort;
and he could not hope to get to his father&#8217;s settlement
with the soldiers in less than a day more,
even if they were mounted. It was now about
two o&#8217;clock, and he had eaten nothing since
early in the morning; but he thought not of food
as he hurried on. With the accuracy of the
practised pioneer he struck a bee-line for the fort.
This took him some miles away from any village;
but towards night he reached a cabin standing
alone. Entering, he found the family just taking
their evening meal. With true western hospitality,
the man of the house urged him to sit down
and partake with them, while his wife poured out
a generous bowl of strong, black coffee, which,
as was the custom, was used without sugar or
milk; and she heaped his plate with fried pork,
and hot, mealy potatoes, while by the side of his
plate she laid a generous slice of brown bread.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>Tom partook with a relish that did honor to the
fare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you from, and where are you
bound, my lad?&#8221; asked the man, who had refrained
from questions until he saw that his guest
was well under way eating.</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s mouth and heart were full, and between
them both he found it difficult to reply. He was
painfully hungry from his long fast and the thrilling
experiences of the day, and his brain was
greatly excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going,&#8221; said he, answering the last
question first, perhaps because it was nearest at
hand, &#8220;to the fort after help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After help!&#8221; cried the wife, stopping short in
the act of transferring a potato from the end of
her fork to Tom&#8217;s plate, holding it aloft unconsciously.
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t any trouble down your way
with the Injuns&ndash;is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not exactly,&#8221; said Tom.</p>
<p>And the good woman, relieved, remembered
the potato, and deposited it as she had designed,
then was proceeding to place another slice of
pork beside it, just as Tom added,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I saw lots of them this morning not more
than twelve miles from here, and they looked
fierce enough in their war-paint, and with the
bloody scalps dangling from their bodies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness gracious!&#8221; exclaimed the good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
lady; and, again forgetting herself, she paused
with the pork, letting the fat drip upon the
snowy cloth. &#8220;I told you, husband, they&#8217;d be
down upon us yet, and we more&#8217;n three miles
from any neighbor.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as Tom commenced his recital of the
occurrences of the morning, she sat down in her
chair with the slice of meat still in its elevated
position, and the gravy dripping into her lap,
while the husband ceased eating, and listened
with open-mouthed interest.</p>
<p>Tom eyed the pork longingly as he continued
his narration, and, seeing no prospect of getting
it, abruptly said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t tasted a bit of food till I came here
since five o&#8217;clock this morning, and I&#8217;ve got to
Walk all night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Law me!&#8221; ejaculated his good-hearted hostess;
&#8220;if I haven&#8217;t forgot to help ye, I was so
scared &#8217;bout the Injuns;&#8221; and she passed it, adding,
&#8220;Husband, you jist go down cellar, and
bring up a pumpkin pie, and some o&#8217; that gingerbread.
The boy mustn&#8217;t leave this huss till he&#8217;s
had his fill;&#8221; and the tears came into her large
blue eyes. &#8220;And are you going with the sojers
over among the Injuns where your father and
mother is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it seems to me that a stripling like you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
had best stay behind, and keep out o&#8217; danger.
One o&#8217; them Injuns wouldn&#8217;t make nothin&#8217; o&#8217; taking
your scalp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s spirit rose at this, and he told them how
he killed the Indian in the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; said the good lady, in blank
astonishment. &#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose my husband
here would be any more dependence if them wild
critters should come beseeching our dwelling than
a three-year-old.&#8221;</p>
<p>At which the husband thrust his hand up into
his wiry hair, till he made it stand upon end all
over his head, while he grew very red in the
face, and said, fiercely,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the varmints come on if they wants to.
Guess I could stand it if you could.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom saw that there was danger of a falling
out between his fat, overgrown hostess and her
diminutive husband, and adroitly said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t any one of us know what we could
do until the time comes. I was surprised myself
at what I had done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the woman, restored to good
humor, &#8220;there&#8217;s a great deal o&#8217; good sense in
that remark. I know it from experience. For
when I had the toothache so that I couldn&#8217;t sleep
nights for a week, and husband wanted to take
me over to Groveville, to the doctor&#8217;s, I felt as
weak as dish-water; but when I got there, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
had out two jaw teeth and a stump without wincin&#8217;,
as you may say, and the doctor said he&#8217;d
like me for a subject to pull on all the time. But
I told him it would take two to make a bargain
on that, I reckoned;&#8221; and she laughed heartily
at the remembrance of her own wit.</p>
<p>But Tom had finished his meal, and rose to go,
when his hostess said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t think o&#8217;travelling in the night&ndash;will
yer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every moment is precious,&#8221; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, husband,&#8221; said she, &#8220;if the boy feels,
under the circumstances, that he must go, it isn&#8217;t
in me to detain him. But it seems to me we orter
do as we&#8217;d be did by, and help him onto his
way a piece. Now, you jist go and harness the
hoss into the waggin while I put up something
to stay his stomach like till he gets to the fort.
You could drive him there just as well as not,
husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty long drive,&#8221; observed the man, looking
out of the little window dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, but,&#8221; she persisted, &#8220;you see the child&#8217;s
got to go all the way afoot, and it&#8217;ll take so long
that his folks&#8217;ll be killed, murdered, tomahawked,
and scalped, afore he can git there.&#8221; Then,
waxing warm, &#8220;an&#8217; if you an&#8217; I was in that perdicament,
we&#8217;d want them as was going to help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
us not to aggervate our feelin&#8217;s by coming to our
rescue when it was too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; returned the little man, unable to
reply to his wife&#8217;s wordy reasoning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you&#8217;re not afeard&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Afeard!</i>&#8221; said he, bristling his hair, and
reddening again. &#8220;Who&#8217;s afeard? I was only
thinking, if the Injuns should come whilst I&#8217;m
gone, what would become of you, Barbery
Jane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said she, looking aghast, and sinking
into her chair anew, &#8220;I declare, if I hadn&#8217;t forgot
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>But she was a person who &#8220;made it a point&#8221;
to carry her point in all domestic arrangements
and controversies with her lord; and partly on
this principle, and partly, we hope, from a worthier
motive, she rallied, and added,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll risk it, if you will, James. An&#8217; I&#8217;m
more in danger &#8217;n you are, bein&#8217; I&#8217;m so fleshy.
You can hide most anywhere in the woods, and
they couldn&#8217;t find ye any more &#8217;n a needle in a
haymow; an&#8217; I never could stand it to think on&#8217;t
that we&#8217;d been sich cowards&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cowards!&#8221; interrupted her husband, goaded
by this; for on the matter of size and courage he
was specially sore&ndash;a wound which his spouse
took care to keep open. &#8220;Cowards!&#8221; and, bristling
about, and striking his feet together, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
bustled out, and, with commendable energy, soon
had the horse in the buggy before the door. Tom
sprang in, as the kind-hearted woman passed him
a bountiful supply of provisions, saying, as she
wiped her eyes with her apron,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope next time you come this way you&#8217;ll
be alive an&#8217; well; but I&#8217;m dreadful afeard the
Injuns&#8217;ll git ye.&#8221; The latter remark seemed to
have more effect upon her husband than Tom,
for the flush disappeared from his cheeks again.</p>
<p>The ponderous wife watched the wagon until
it was out of sight, then, with much pains, fastened
the little window and the outer door, and,
going to her trunk, took from thence a copy of
the Bible, and sat down and read a chapter&ndash;a
duty which she always performed on extra occasions,
and especially in times of danger. It
mattered not to her what chapter she read; and
she now opened to the genealogical records in
First Chronicles. She was a poor reader at best;
but she struggled on with those names of foreign
accent, feeling much safer with the exercise, while
her thoughts were far away, following Tom and
her husband. In truth, she had done a good
deed, and one that had cost her a real sacrifice,
in sending away her husband with the horse to
accompany the lad; and the consciousness of
this began to fill her with happiness, calmed as
she was by the feeling of security which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
use of the good Book imparted. Hers was a
simple-hearted faith; but who shall say that she
was not accepted and blessed according to the
measure of her light?</p>
<p>Who would not choose to be such a one,
with her defective knowledge and her weak
superstition,&ndash;as some would call it,&ndash;than the
proud sceptic, ever croaking, like some hideous
night-bird, as he turns his bleared eyes away
from the beams of the Sun of Righteousness,
&#8220;No God, no Bible, no Saviour, no Heaven of
blessedness, no Immortality,&#8221; wandering through
life without hope and God in the world, and, at
death, taking a frightful &#8220;leap in the dark&#8221;!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>A BELEAGUERED CABIN.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was a misty morning when Tom and his
companion approached the fort. The air was
damp with vapor, and the American flag, with
its glorious stars and stripes, drooped heavily.
The fortress was on the very outskirts of civilization,
on an elevated point of land, commanding
an extensive prospect on every side. Richly
diversified prairies, rarely pressed by the white
man&#8217;s foot, gave one an impressive sense of vastness
and magnificence. As the sun arose, and
the curtain of fog rolled off, Tom gazed on the
landscape, spell-bound; for, accustomed as he
was to prairie scenery, he had never seen any
view that equalled this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not an Injun could come nigh this ere fort,&#8221;
said the little man that held the reins; &#8220;everybody
has to be seen, no matter how fur off they be,
specially when the officers gits their telescopes to
their eyes. Why, I suppose they can see hundreds
o&#8217; miles with one of them big glasses; any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
rate, I heard tell about their seeing clean up to
the stars, an&#8217; a good piece beyend.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had now approached a gate, before which
paced an armed sentry, in answer to whose challenge,
the little man, who grew consequential as
he neared the citadel, said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;This ere youngster, Mr. Sojer, wants to see
the commander of this ere institution on very perticler
business, which admits of no delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man with the gun sent a message into the
fort without a word in reply, until the messenger
returned, when he said, laconically,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pass in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom had never before seen a fortress, and surveyed
with eager interest the rows of heavy guns,
and the cannon-balls in conical shaped piles, and
the long, four-storied brick buildings extending
around the spacious square, from the centre of
which rose the flagstaff. Grimly as frowned the
guns and warlike munitions, the neatness and
order that reigned had a pleasing effect on Tom&#8217;s
mind. And within those many-roomed buildings,
standing amid the solitudes of the wilderness, in
the families of the officers gayety and mirth often
held carnival. Already a gush of music, elicited
by fair fingers from a richly-toned piano, was
borne through an open window into the court
below. Then a clear, sweet voice accompanied
the instrument.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pooty as a bird, and a plaguy sight nicer,&#8221;
exclaimed the little man as he frisked about,
hitching his horse to an iron-ringed post.</p>
<p>Tom and his friend were shown into the dining-room
of the commander of the fort. The officer
was an early riser, and breakfasted betimes. The
mahogany extension table was set with an elegant
service. General McElroy was a tall, slender
man, with iron-gray hair and weather-beaten
face. His wife, a richly-dressed, stately lady, sat
at the head of the table, and a boy of seven, in
Highland costume, was at her side, while black
Nancy flitted in and out with viands in her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my lad,&#8221; said the general, sedately,
&#8220;what do you want of me?&#8221; motioning his callers
to be seated.</p>
<p>Tom commenced to state the occasion of his
calling, and the general&#8217;s stolid features lighted
up with growing interest; and he said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, my boy; I guess you&#8217;ve a
message important enough, and it will save time
for you to relate it to two of us at once;&#8221; and pulling
a bell-rope, a soldier appeared, to whom he
said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Captain Manly that I wish to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a moment the last-named personage came
in. He was about forty, of frank, open face, and
soldierly bearing. Tom liked him at the first
glance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Captain,&#8221; said the general, &#8220;I want you to
hear this boy&#8217;s story. Commence again, my lad,
and state the whole as briefly and connectedly as
you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Tom finished his recital, &#8220;You are a
brave little fellow,&#8221; said the general, &#8220;and in my
opinion, if you were in the ranks, you would
be sure to be well spoken of;&#8221; then turning to the
captain, he added, &#8220;This is grave business,
Manly, and something should be done for the settlers
whom this boy represents. I heard that an
Indian called at the fort, and tried to make us
understand that there was an uprising; and I suppose
it was this Long Hair that the lad tells about,
but I did not attach much importance to what he
said. And now, Manly, I want you to take a
detachment of men,&ndash;for I think I can depend
on you to do it up right. See that they are well
mounted and provisioned, and that their arms are
in good order,&ndash;but you understand all about
that,&ndash;and go to the relief of the settlement that
these villains have beset.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then turning to Tom, he asked,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name, young man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thomas Jones,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Thomas, I conclude you will want to
go with the men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And do you know, the shortest route to the
settlement in question?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom answered affirmatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Include a horse for the boy&#8217;s use, captain,
and see that he is well provided for. He may be
of use in piloting the way. At any rate he is a
noble-spirited fellow, and deserves consideration
at our hands. How many men will you need,
captain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d as lief have forty as more, if I can have
my pick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make such arrangements as will please you;
and I hope to have a good report when you come
back. The rascally red-skins should be taught
a severe lesson for this outrage, or they may commit
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom and his friend rose to withdraw with the
under-officer, when the general said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have not told me how far you came
this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We rode all night,&#8221; returned Tom; &#8220;I took
supper at this man&#8217;s cabin, and he brought me
here in his wagon to save time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless me!&#8221; ejaculated the general, as he left
the table; &#8220;that has the true ring in it. Nancy,
see that these folks have a sip of coffee, and
something to eat, and when you&#8217;ve broke your
fast, my lad, come out into the square. I guess
the captain will be ready by that time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>Tom felt some diffidence about accepting the
invitation of the general; but Mrs. McElroy
was a true lady, and her winning smile, as she
filled his cup with the fragrant beverage from the
silver urn, put him at ease. She had many a
woman&#8217;s question to ask about his adventures of
yesterday morning, and seemed never to tire admiring
his heroic conduct. He was just explaining
for the third time how he pushed the savage
from the cliff, when his voice was drowned by
that of a girl, who came tripping and singing
through the long hall that led into the dining-room.
Hers were the same bird-like notes that came
through the open window. It was the general&#8217;s
only daughter, Alice, who, as she burst into the
apartment, stopped in surprise as she saw strangers
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just in time, Alice,&#8221; said the mother, pleasantly,
&#8220;to hear this story.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was scarcely in her teens, and her fair
face, expressive of good sense, gentleness, and
intellectuality, was set off by a wealth of auburn
curls that fell in careless profusion over her
shoulders.</p>
<p>Tom had never known anything of sentiment,
or thought much of personal looks, but he had a
quick eye for grace and beauty, and, charmed at
the unexpected ingress of the little fairy, he forgot
alike his food, his manners, and his story, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
gazed in stupid silence at the lovely apparition.
The mother comprehended the state of things,
and, with a look of gratified maternal pride, said
to Tom,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you mustn&#8217;t forget your plate; you have
had a long ride, you know, and have another
before you.&#8221;</p>
<p>This recalled Tom to his senses, and in his
straightforward, manly way he finished the account
of the affair.</p>
<p>&#8220;The captain&#8217;s most ready,&#8221; said black Nancy,
glancing out of the window, as Tom finished his
repast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farewell, my boy,&#8221; said Mrs. McElroy. &#8220;I
wish you success, and hope no harm will come to
you;&#8221; and Tom went out and mounted the horse
that had been provided for him, and shaking
hands with the kind settler who brought him
there, he saw Mrs. McElroy and Alice waving
their handkerchiefs, as he and the men rode in
military order out of the square.</p>
<p>The horses were in good order, and the men
in fine spirits, glad, after their idle life within the
fort, to be sent on active duty. The day was
almost cloudless, the air pure and bracing, and
they coursed the smooth prairies at a rapid rate.
Yet to Tom&#8217;s anxious heart the moments seemed
long; and when they stopped at noon for refreshment,
and to bait the horses, Tom could scarcely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
brook the delay. He was really on his way with
a brave band for the rescue. The thought of
this was joyful to him, yet he was afraid that they
might arrive too late; and as the soldiers lay upon
the grass eating their rations, Captain Manly,
reading his feelings, said to him,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be patient, my dear boy; be patient. The
old saying, &#8216;Prayer and provender hinder no
man&#8217;s journey,&#8217; is as true in war as in peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was a Christian soldier, and he added,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must pray, Tom, that God will prosper us.
By this bit of rest the men and horses will be all
the better for service when we catch up with the
savages; and if God shall so order it, we will
save such of the poor settlers as have escaped
from massacre.&#8221;</p>
<p>About the middle of the afternoon they drew
near one of the settlements that lay in their path.
Scouts were sent ahead to see if any Indians
were lurking in the vicinity. They reported that
none were to be seen, but that the village had
been totally destroyed. Putting spurs to their
horses, the eager soldiers were soon on the ground.</p>
<p>The air was still heavy with the smell of the
burning, and as they passed along they saw that
every cabin had been consumed. It was a scene
of utter desolation. The horses&#8217; feet splashed in
pools of clotted blood, while ever and anon they
came to the mutilated remains of some victim of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
the massacre. In one place lay the form of a
brawny pioneer, his broken rifle still clutched by
the muzzle, while the ground around him was
torn up by the mighty struggle he had made with
his assailants. Here young children had been
murdered by being dashed against a tree. To
an oak near by a woman had been nailed while
yet alive. All the corpses were horribly mangled
and disfigured, indignities the most fiendish being
heaped upon them. Their ears and noses were
cut off, sticks were thrust into their eyes, and
their mouths were filled with filth.</p>
<p>These awful sights wrought up the soldiers to
frenzy. Tom&#8217;s passions rose also; but he was
startled by the deadly paleness that sat upon the
countenances of the others, so expressive of intensified
hate and desire for revenge. But the
scouts again appeared, and reported a large force
of Indians encamped before a log house a few
miles farther on; and Captain Manly decided
to strike for a piece of woods to the right of the
savages. When the woods were reached, it was
discovered that all the dwellings on either side of
the besieged cabin, comprising three promising
young villages, had been swept away. Cautiously
the little company pushed on to the scene
of action. Before the lone cabin were assembled
hundreds of Indians, engaged in some savage
ceremony.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They have taken a captive,&#8221; whispered Captain
Manly, &#8220;and have brought him near the
cabin to tantalize the inmates, hoping to induce
them to make a sortie for the rescue of the prisoner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Long Hair!&#8221; replied Tom, wild with
excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quiet, be quiet, my boy,&#8221; replied the captain;
&#8220;we&#8217;ll be in <i>their</i> long hair before they get
his, if they don&#8217;t look sharp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then dividing his force into four companies of
ten men each, and directing them to crawl carefully
through the long grass to the points he designated
near the foe, he instructed each man to be
sure of his aim, and fire when the captain&#8217;s division
fired. The Indians had been so successful
in their attacks on the settlements thus far, and
so unmolested in their barbarities, that they were
now completely off their guard, which enabled
the whites to get close to them unobserved.</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s eyes were fastened upon Long Hair.
The faithful Indian&#8217;s handsome face betrayed no
fear, but it was evident that he had given up all
hopes of deliverance. With eagle eye he watched
the ceremonies, and, as he saw them approach
their fatal termination, began to chant his death-song.
Captain Manly understood Indian customs,
and telling certain of his men to make sure
of the savages nearest Long Hair, he gave the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
signal, and the bullets of the ten unerring marksmen
mowing them down, firing from the other
detachments following with deadly effect.</p>
<p>The panic of the Indians was indescribable;
for the firing from so extended a line gave the
impression of a much larger force than had really
attacked them. Their confusion was increased
also at seeing some soldiers issue from the woods,
mounted; for the captain had given orders, in
case there was a panic, for a portion of the
command quietly and quickly to take to their
horses and pursue the fugitives. Thinking themselves
attacked by superior numbers of both
cavalry and infantry, the Indians were at the
mercy of the soldiers, who shot and sabred them
with small opposition.</p>
<p>As soon as Captain Manly saw the effect of
the first volley, he said to Tom,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall leave Long Hair in your charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>For with delicate magnanimity he would have
Tom be the deliverer of the noble Indian who
had perilled his life for Tom.</p>
<p>The lad needed no second hint, but sprang
away, and severed the thongs that bound his Indian
friend to the death-stake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh! Tom good friend; big soldier-boy,&#8221;
ejaculated the grateful Indian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are father and mother safe?&#8221; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;In cabin there,&#8221; replied Long Hair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>Tom hurried forward towards the dwelling,
but Long Hair seized him, saying,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they think you Injun; shoot you!&#8221; for
his keen eye had caught sight of the muzzle of a
gun pointing at them from out an aperture in the
building. &#8220;White chief come soon,&#8221; he immediately
added. &#8220;They no fire at you; see, gun
gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scarcely had he uttered these words, when the
outer door opened, and Tom saw his mother
standing there, for she had discerned him in the
deepening twilight, and recognized him as her
son. Tom, with a bound, hastened to her, and
as she folded him in her arms, and tenderly kissed
him, he inquired,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where is father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak softly,&#8221; she replied, as she led the way
to a bed in a corner of the inner building, on
which lay Mr. Jones. &#8220;He is wounded,&#8221; said
she, mournfully, &#8220;and is sleeping now. We cannot
yet tell how it will turn with him, but hope
for the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where are the other men?&#8221; asked Tom,
weeping, for only a few women and children
were in sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;They deserted us night before last. Our provisions
had run low, and the savages had retired
to make us think they had left, and the men, half
crazed with sleepless nights and scanty food,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
were deluded by the idea that they might get
safely away, and perhaps bring us aid. But,
poor things, they were not themselves, and they
had gone only a few rods, when they were set
upon by the savages, and brutally slaughtered
before our eyes. We used our guns on the Indians
as well as we could, but found it difficult
to prevent them from scaling the building.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did <i>you</i> fire upon them?&#8221; asked Tom, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my son,&#8221; said she, gently; &#8220;and last
night, knowing how feeble our force must be,
they were emboldened to attempt to burn the
house. The roof caught in several places, and
your father went up and put out the fire at the
risk of his life. It was then that he was shot.
He had been our main defence from the first, for
the Indians were more afraid of his rifle than a
dozen of others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did you get along after father was
disabled?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We women loaded, watched, and fired by
turns. I do not see how we could have held out
an hour longer. Help came just in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where are all the children,&#8221; inquired Tom,
forebodingly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones gave a low moan, as if her heart
would break, but, with wonderful self-command,
suppressed all other manifestations of emotion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
and said, lovingly, laying her hand on his shoulder,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;My son, we are a broken family; we shall
never all meet again on earth. Charlie disappeared
at the first attack. I did not see him
killed; and you know what a quick, active boy
he is, and he may have escaped, although the
chances were fearfully against him. Sarah was
overtaken by an Indian, and tomahawked while
flying home from the store.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Bub?&#8221; sobbed Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was one of the crudest of the cruelties
connected with the outbreak. There was an Indian
who made great professions of friendship,
visiting our cabin almost daily. You saw him,
Tom, when you visited us. We treated him very
kindly, and made him many presents. He
seemed to have a particular liking to Bub, and
Bub was fond of him, and would always run to
meet him when he saw him coming. The day
of the fatal attack, he made his appearance as
usual, and Bub, with an exclamation of joy, hastened
to be the first to greet him, when, as the
child drew laughingly near, the treacherous
savage raised his rifle, and shot him through the
head. This was the signal for the assault. Sarah
was standing at the time in the store door opposite,
and, seeing the murder, started for the house,
her face terribly pale with fright. So terrified
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
was she that it seemed as if she flew rather than
ran; but the same savage swiftly pursued her,
and, being nearer the house than she, struck her
down with his tomahawk. But Robert has been
left to us, and a brave, good boy has he been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom was so absorbed that he had not noticed
the quiet entrance of Captain Manly and others
of the command, who, seated or standing around
the room, listened intently to his mother&#8217;s account
of the massacre. As she concluded, the captain
said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had taken the precaution, madam, to bring
the surgeon along with me; and if you desire it,
he will examine your husband&#8217;s wounds, and see
what is best to be done for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>At which the doctor stepped forward and proceeded
to probe and dress the wound.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an ugly hurt,&#8221; remarked the surgeon,
&#8220;but by good care and nursing he may rally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what are impossible,&#8221; answered the captain,
&#8220;in this place. Would it do to remove him,
doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If a good litter was prepared,&#8221; was the reply,
&#8220;there would be less risk in doing so than in
leaving him in this wretched hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Particularly,&#8221; added the captain, &#8220;as the red-skins
would be sure to come back to finish their
fiendish work. And I would propose, madam,
that, after my men have taken a little rest, we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
remove you and your family at once to the fort,
where you shall receive the best of attention, and
everything be done for your husband that skill
and medicine and needful comforts can do for his
recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones glanced at the ghastly wound of
her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand your feelings,&#8221; said the captain,
kindly; &#8220;but you have shown that you are a brave
woman, ever ready to do what is for the best.
Now, the Indians to-night were some three or four
hundred strong; and, panic-stricken as they were,
some of them must have discovered that I have
but a handful of men. They will return in larger
force, thirsting for revenge. It is therefore indispensable
that we take Mr. Jones with us. It is
all we can do under the circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones saw the propriety of this, and gratefully
assented to the captain&#8217;s plan, and at the
hour appointed&ndash;all the preparations having
been efficiently made&ndash;the wounded man was
carefully placed upon the nicely-constructed litter,
the women and children taken upon the soldiers&#8217;
horses, and the little cavalcade moved noiselessly
out on the star-lighted prairie.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>THE MYSTERIOUS FIRE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Few words were spoken, as the handful of
brave men, with the rescued women and children,
and the suffering squatter moved on. Experienced
scouts were thrown out on either hand,
to give notice of danger, for at any moment the
wily foe might spring upon them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where can Long Hair be?&#8221; whispered Tom
to his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot imagine,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;he left
the cabin as I was telling you about the loss of
the children through the treachery of Yellow
Bank. His eyes glared while I was speaking,
and there was a look on his face that I could not
interpret. Do you suppose he is trusty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trusty!&#8221; echoed Tom; &#8220;why, mother, he
perilled his life for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know it, child; he is unlike any Indian
I ever saw. But why did he leave so mysteriously?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Tom. &#8220;Captain Manly
tried to find him; he wished to present him to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
General McElroy. He said he did not doubt
that government would reward Long Hair for
his services.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; sighed his mother, shuddering as she
spoke, &#8220;how different these Indians are from us!
They come and go so noiselessly, and talk so
little! But what is that?&#8221; she exclaimed, glancing
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; inquired Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that light,&#8221;&ndash;pointing in the direction
from which they came. And Tom saw against
the dark woods, for a background, thick flying
sparks from the cabin chimney made themselves
visible for miles across the prairie.</p>
<p>A scout now rode up, to call the attention of
the captain to the same appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot comprehend it!&#8221; ejaculated that
officer, putting his glass to his eyes. &#8220;It is
clear that the cabin is not on fire. It seems to
be occupied.&#8221; And, riding up to Mrs. Jones,
he said, &#8220;Madam, can you tell me if there was
any fuel in the fireplace when we left?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was not,&#8221; was the decided reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is a large fire burning on the hearth
now; how do you account for that? It&#8217;s a trick
of the savages,&#8221; he muttered, as he put spurs to
his steed; &#8220;and yet,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it is not like the
Indians to go into a house and make a fire. If
they had discovered our retreat, they would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
too cunning thus to let us know that they had
found it out; we should see them prowling around
as stealthily as so many panthers. Somebody&#8217;s
alive and stirring there; who can it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>The singular incident served to heighten the
anxiety of all, and stimulate the soldiers to make
as good progress as they could without too
greatly distressing the wounded man. Several
times, in the dim light, the groaning and pallor
of her husband led Mrs. Jones to fear he was
dying, and, with Tom and Robert, she watched
every change in his appearance, tenderly ministering
to him. Fresh relays of men took the
places of those who bore him, taking their turn
at the litter with alacrity, for Tom&#8217;s dutiful and
heroic conduct, and the mother&#8217;s loving gentleness
and patient endurance, and the squatter&#8217;s
stubborn defence of the lone cabin against such
odds, had won the hearts of the soldiers, and
they had resolved to see the family safe within
the walls of the fortress, or, if attacked on the
prairie, to defend them to the death.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did it happen,&#8221; asked Captain Manly,
in a low voice, of the mother, &#8220;that your cabin
was enclosed with those walls of heavy logs.
Were you expecting an attack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Long Hair gave us warning,&#8221; she replied;
&#8220;and husband persuaded the settlers to cut down
trees and build the walls.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And your husband directed the defence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and he made a sortie, and
rescued a number of neighbors, who would otherwise
have been murdered,&ndash;the very persons
who afterwards deserted in the night, leaving,
in their haste, the outer door wide open. We
should all have been sacrificed before morning,
had we not been startled at seeing Long Hair
standing in the cabin. How he got in undiscovered
through so many enemies, and notified
us of our danger in so timely a manner, we could
not conjecture. Husband secured the door again,
and Long Hair vanished as he came, saying,
&#8216;Long Hair go quick, get sojer, come right back
bimeby, quick!&#8217; that was, I suppose, when he
came to the fort, as Tom told us about, and not
succeeding in his errand, hurried to find Tom,
to intercede with you for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have had a hard time of it,&#8221; said the
captain, &#8220;and your husband stood a siege before
which a well-manned fort might have fallen. I
only hope that the brave fellow&#8217;ll get well, and
enjoy the fruits of his noble conduct. If I had a
few hundred men like him, I could sweep the
red-skins from the soil.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the jarring, and the motion, and the pain
were proving too much for the wounded pioneer,
and delirium setting in, he began to rave, speaking,
however, slowly and distinctly, and without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
a tinge of the squatter dialect, but in the purer
English of his early days.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he exclaimed, pointing his finger,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve come again. I knew you would not let
me rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s thinking of the Indians,&#8221; remarked the
captain, sorrowfully; &#8220;the confounded red-skins!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you he stole it all. Will you harass
me into my grave? A set of vampires, sucking
the life-blood of an honest man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now he wanders,&#8221; said the captain; and,
sending for the surgeon, the latter opened his
medicine case, and, lighting a match to read the
labels on his vials, administered an opiate, and
the sufferer sank into a troubled stupor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; whispered the mother to Tom, &#8220;it is
not the savages that disturb his mind so; it&#8217;s the
old agony of a wounded spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>About noon, the next day, they came in sight
of the fort. How welcome the frowning walls to
the weary women and children! How sublime
seemed the national flag, floating proudly on the
breeze, symbol of a united sovereignty of states,
powerful to protect its citizens on the ocean and
the land, in the teeming city, and in the wilds
of the wilderness!</p>
<p>General McElroy received the settlers in the
kindest manner, causing them to feel at once that
they were among friends. Airy, quiet apartments
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
were assigned to the wounded man and
his household, and the ladies of the garrison vied
with each other in their attentions to him and his
stricken family. Often would Mrs. McElroy
come in and sit by Mr. Jones, that his wife might
get some rest. With her and her husband Tom
had become a great favorite, and they entertained
a high respect for the mother.</p>
<p>The squatter&#8217;s life in the open air, roaming the
prairies, tended to build up for him a healthy
physical organization, favorable to the healing of
the wound; and as this progressed, the doctor
marvelled that he did not get stronger. He was
strangely liable to delirious attacks, and opiates
gradually lost their influence over him.</p>
<p>One day the surgeon entered as his patient,
wildly raving, was exclaiming, with great vehemence,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, again, that I have nothing to pay
with, and you will give me no chance to earn.
O, what a load to carry! Debt! debt! debt!
Shall I never find rest?&#8221; Then, in a moment
more, his thoughts relapsing to another subject,
he murmured, &#8220;What did the preacher say?
&#8217;Come&ndash;unto&ndash;me&ndash;and I will&ndash;give you
rest;&#8217; yes, that is what I want. O, if only I
could come!&#8221;</p>
<p>The surgeon watched him through the delirium,
and said,&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Madam, it is not the bullet of the savage
that&#8217;s killing your husband, but some more deadly
sore. He needs medicine for the mind, rather
than the body; and when he is himself, you
had better call in the chaplain to converse with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour later, when Mr. Jones had an easy
interval, she gently said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Husband, you are very sick. Don&#8217;t you
think it might do you good to have a little talk
with the minister?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Minister!&#8221; he feebly answered; &#8220;what minister?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The minister that belongs to the fort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know him,&#8221; replied the sick man,
suspiciously. &#8220;But there is <i>one</i> minister that I
do know,&#8221; he added, after a moment&#8217;s pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, <i>him</i>!&#8221; he answered, impatiently, as if
he thought she ought to understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the missionary,&#8221; she returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; if I could talk with him, I would like to.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wife mentioned his remarks to the surgeon,
and General McElroy sent for the missionary.</p>
<p>It was evening, of a lowering, rainy day, when
the messenger returned with Mr. Payson. It had
been drizzling and dripping all day, but towards
night the clouds grew black and wild, and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
furious wind dashed the big rain-drops violently
against the window. The air was raw, and
seemed to pierce to the bones. The old fort
buildings were delightful in fair weather, but
now were damp and chilly. Mrs. Jones feared
for the effect of the storm on her husband, whose
frame, since his wound, had been extremely sensitive
to atmospheric changes; and dreading that,
if he was disturbed, he would relapse into delirium,
she concluded not to invite the missionary
in to see him until morning. She had disposed
everything as comfortably as possible about the
bed, and had a nourishing broth and his medicines
handy, when Mrs. McElroy entered, and
said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look worn out. Go and take a nap
now, and if you are needed I will call you.
You know the missionary is here, and will wish
to be with him in the morning; and it is desirable
that you should feel as well as you can, to
encourage your husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones, thus charged, retired to an adjoining
room, thinking to rest herself for a short
time, and then return. She felt that a great event
was impending, and thought it impossible for her
to close her eyes; but so utterly exhausted was
she, that she immediately fell into a sound sleep,
from which she was awakened at midnight by
Mrs. McElroy, who said,&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A great change has come over your husband.
I think he is going to get well. He
wants to see you and the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hurrying to her husband&#8217;s side, she found him
sitting up in bed as composedly as if no trouble
had ever disturbed the serenity of his mind, looking
much as he did in their bridal hour. He
had called for a bowl of water and a towel, and
was calmly washing himself. Bestowing on her
a loving look as she entered, he asked,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary, dear, has the missionary come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I see him now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McElroy took out her watch, and said,
pleasantly,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you particular about seeing him now? I
suppose you are not aware how late it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;it is twelve o&#8217;clock;&#8221;
and his eye shone with a strange intelligence.
&#8220;I should have sent for him a year ago, had not
my heart been so proud and bitter. But I know
<i>him</i>. He&#8217;ll come now, if it is late.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something unearthly in his manner,
and Mrs. McElroy said, rising,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shall be as you request.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Mr. Payson entered, the sick man extended
his hand, saying,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m almost through, my friend. I&#8217;ve had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
some sore trials in life,&ndash;not so much on my
own account as because of those who were too
dear to me. We were cruelly wronged, and I
have not been quite right here,&#8221;&ndash;placing his
hand upon his forehead,&ndash;&#8220;and what has made
it worse, I have been all wrong here,&#8221;&ndash;laying
his hand upon his heart. &#8220;I have doubted everybody,
and distrusted my God. I have been hard
and scornful, and hated my fellows; but it is
different with me now. I have heard that voice
speaking to me, that you told us of in the little
cabin. He has said unto me, even me, &#8216;Come,&#8217;
and he has given me &#8216;rest.&#8217; I have had a long,
long struggle, but the conflict is over. Ah, He
is so different from human creditors! I have
been a poor debtor, chased, hunted, oppressed,
goaded almost to insanity, and none took pity on
me, because I owed them a few paltry dollars,
which I had the heart to pay, but, through the
robberies of another, and their oppressions, could
not. But what a debt I owed my Savior! Yet,
without a word of reproach, he has forgiven
me all!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was spoken with a wondrous energy and
clearness of voice; but a deathly paleness began
to overspread his face; partial delirium supervened,
not raging, as before, but his features
lighted up the while with a smile of heavenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
beauty, and repeating again, his voice sinking
to a whisper,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did the preacher say? &#8216;Come unto
me, and I will give you rest.&#8217; Rest! Rest! It
is mine.&#8221; His spirit was gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>THE BOY IN THE TREE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Charlie was a boy who naturally loved adventure.
He was excitable, and yet had a reserved
power, which, in great emergencies, made
him cool and brave. He was fertile in expedients,
and, when aroused, experienced a rollicking
enjoyment in danger. In the little settlement he
came across an old copy of Robinson Crusoe,
and, charmed with its romantic descriptions, conceived
the idea of becoming another Crusoe.
But there was a serious obstacle in his way. He
could not convert a prairie into an ocean, and get
shipwrecked. Yet if he lacked salt water, there
was many a man Friday at hand,&ndash;for he mentally
promoted every friendly Indian to that office,&ndash;and
there were plenty of cannibals in the shape
of disaffected Indians who were already threatening
the settlements with depredation and carnage.
Now, Charlie, to enjoy his book under
congenial circumstances, and where he would not
be interrupted by his mother saying, &#8220;Charlie,
bring some wood,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie, get some water,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
and the various et-ceteras of domestic duty to
which boys of his age and active habits are liable,
looked about for some safe retreat, and
chanced to find, one day, in the woods near at
hand, a large, hollow tree. Many a time had he
passed it, and not discovered the welcome fact.
The entrance was effectually concealed by a
tangled clump of bushes. Had they taken it
specially in hand to grow in such a way as to
hide the hole in the tree, they could not have done
it more thoroughly; and nobody but a prying
young Crusoe of Charlie&#8217;s qualifications would
have spied out the entrance. Having discovered
it, he would creep slyly in, and, by means of
the light let in through a hole higher up in the
trunk, would pore over the haps and mishaps of
the Juan Fernandez hero, and imitate his achievements
as well as he could.</p>
<p>It got to be a great mystery what became of
Charlie through the long hours of the day. He
could hear and see much of what passed around
him, and, with imperturbable gravity, would sit
in his sly retreat, making no answer, while his
mother would come to the cabin door, and call,
in silvery treble,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlie! Charlie! Where are you, Charlie?&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, in turn, the father would make his
appearance, and shout, in masculine bass,&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Charlie, Charlie, your mother wants yer.
Why don&#8217;t you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>After a while Sarah would be despatched to
search for him, and her girlish voice would repeat
the parents&#8217; calls as she looked everywhere
in vain.</p>
<p>Then, when he returned to the house, to the
accustomed inquiry, &#8220;Why, where have you
been? We&#8217;ve been calling you, and hunting
everywhere for you,&#8221; he would reply, with the
utmost nonchalance, &#8220;O, only out here;&#8221; at
which Sarah would retort, impatiently, &#8220;I know
better than that; for I hunted all round for you,
and you wasn&#8217;t anywhere to be seen;&#8221; and Charlie
respond, with compassionate condescension,
&#8220;Pooh! girls are great at hunting!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, it was very wrong in Charlie to be so
dumb when his parents wanted him, and to cause
them so much concern by his unexplained absence;
but he justified it to his own conscience
on the ground that it was in keeping with his
character as second Crusoe. Robinson Crusoe,
in his estimation, was the greatest and most glorious
man that ever lived. Charlie had taken
him for his model in life; and it would derogate
from the dignity of his position, while enacting
the man Crusoe,&ndash;&#8220;monarch of all he surveyed,&#8221;&ndash;to
obey as the child Charlie. He was willing,
when in the house, to do what was expected of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
him, as a boy under subjection; but when he was
in his Crusoe cave, <i>alias</i> the hollow tree, he was
altogether another person; and he reasoned, in
order to have things in harmony, he must act
accordingly.</p>
<p>Charlie, by some means, had come into possession
of a horse pistol, considerably out of order,
it is true; but it served to fill the place of one of
the two pistols Robinson Crusoe found on board
the Spanish ship. He was in daily expectation
of finding another; but needing ammunition to
store up against a coming fray with the cannibals
on the shore, he helped himself frequently
to the contents of his father&#8217;s powder-horn and
bullet-pouch.</p>
<p>&#8220;What under the canopy makes my powder
go so fast?&#8221; his father often exclaimed, as he replenished
the mysteriously-wasting stock. The
lad also begged ammunition of the free-hearted
settlers, and by these means he laid up a surprisingly
large amount of warlike munitions, kept
securely in an old skin bag. He had also dried
venison stowed away, and a good store of nuts,
with pop-corn for parching, and potatoes for roasting&ndash;all
against some coming time of need.</p>
<p>Now, it chanced that Charlie&#8217;s tree-cave turned
to good account, as it saved his curly scalp; for
the afternoon of the Indian outbreak,&ndash;with one
eye on the Crusoe history, and the other watching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
to see if any cannibals landed on the shore, taking
an occasional sip from an old coffee-pot
filled with spring water, which he called goat&#8217;s
milk,&ndash;the whole frightful scene of the massacre
passed before him. He saw dear little Bub
run to meet Yellow Bank, and he also saw what
his mother did not in the panic, that, just as the
treacherous savage fired, the little fellow tripped
and fell, unharmed by the bullet. He saw, at
that instant, his sister Sarah start from the store
for the cabin, and that the fiendish savage did not
notice Bub&#8217;s escape, in his eagerness to intercept
the girl; so that Bub, terrified by the report of
the gun, and at seeing his sister struck down
by Yellow Bank, dragged himself off in the direction
of Charlie&#8217;s tree, not seeming to know
but that he was going towards the cabin.</p>
<p>He saw the door of the cabin closed, and that
preparations were made to keep out the savages,
and that the whole attention of the Indians was
turned on assaulting the house. So, cautiously
creeping out, and placing one hand firmly over
Bub&#8217;s mouth to prevent him from making a
sound, he drew him into the tree. He was fully
aware that he did this at the risk of his own life;
for if the child made an outcry, their hiding-place
would be discovered, and they would both be
sacrificed. But he had too loving and noble a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
nature to save his own life by leaving his darling
pet brother exposed.</p>
<p>Charlie found it a difficult task to control himself
sufficiently in the scenes that were passing
before him to keep guard over Bub each instant,
as he must, to prevent him from revealing their
place of refuge. The little fellow had received
a terrible fright, and at first struggled with singular
strength to free himself from Charlie&#8217;s
grasp, and Charlie&#8217;s arms ached from the constant
strain in holding him; his efforts, however,
were rewarded at last by Bub&#8217;s beginning to
comprehend the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the wicked Indians,&#8221; whispered Charlie,
&#8220;and they&#8217;ll kill us if we make any noise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three days and nights came and went. How
thankful Charlie was for the provisions and water
which he had unwittingly provided for this fearful
hour! He had the good sense, however, to
be careful of the water; for he knew not how
long he must stay there; and he taught Bub to
eat very slowly, as he had heard his father say
that the hunters did so on the plains to prevent
thirst. It was a terrible ordeal for a boy of his
tender years to witness the horrid sights transpiring
around him; and then, when the neighboring
cabins were fired, he was filled with fear,
lest the cinders would set the tree ablaze.</p>
<p>Charlie hoped, through all this long watching,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
for an opportunity to take refuge with his father
and mother in the cabin; but the savages lay
encamped around him, and several times an Indian
crept upon his hands and knees, and fired
from behind the tree at the inmates of the
cabin.</p>
<p>Three days and nights&ndash;how long they were
to the children in the tree! And yet there was
nothing to indicate that they might not remain
there as much longer, provided the defence of the
cabin continued as persistently as it had done.
There was still a good supply of food, although
the potatoes had to be eaten raw. But the water
grew nauseating, and if some more could not be
obtained, what would they do? Bub began to
be tormented with thirst, and once attempted to
cry for water. He had borne up like a hero,
controlled by his fears, sometimes seeming to
forget his own wants and perils in his baby concern
for his parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will the wicked Indians kill father and mother?&#8221;
he once asked, his blue eyes wide with
horror, and voice too loud for prudence, just as a
savage was creeping up to take aim from behind
the tree, so that Charlie had to guard him with
ceaseless vigilance. But thirst&ndash;how could he
expect that a little boy, like Bub, could long
endure its torments without making his agony
known?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want some water,&#8221; hoarsely whispered Bub;
&#8220;I dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t make any noise, and Charlie&#8217;ll get
you some.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, waiting till after nightfall, Charlie put his
head cautiously out of the hole, and peered
around. The spring was not far off; but Charlie
knew that the savages would be likely to
guard that, and he did not venture to draw his
whole body from the aperture save with the utmost
caution, and very slowly. Satisfying himself
that the Indians were not noticing the tree,
he drew himself completely out, and then, putting
his head in again, whispered,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Bub, don&#8217;t you move nor stir, while I
go for the water. I&#8217;ll be back in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>The heroic boy might have been taken in the
darkness for an overgrown caterpillar, he crawled
so softly towards the spring. He knew that if
he broke a stick or twig, or inadvertently hit his
coffee-pot against an obstacle, the quick ear of the
Indian would be sure to detect it, and yet he was
surprised at his own coolness and mastery of
himself; and he accomplished the feat, returning
with the black old pot filled to the brim.</p>
<p>He had got within a few feet of the tree, when,
in range of the opening, he saw a figure apparently
watching him. Charlie thought his
hour had come; that it was a savage ready with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
his scalping-knife, and had given up all for lost,
when the dark form moved from out the shadow
towards him, and to his consternation he saw that
it was Bub, who trudged forward, saying in a
loud whisper,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has oo dot any water?&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie, to save further noise, chose the bold
alternative of letting him drink on the spot;
and retaining his prostrate condition, quickly put
the pot to Bub&#8217;s lips, and the child swallowed
great draughts with satisfied gutturals that seemed
to Charlie&#8217;s apprehensive ear like the reports of
pocket pistols. He let him drink his fill, however,
then, pulling him down by his chubby legs,
thrust him swiftly, but softly, through the aperture,
following as fast as he could, and keeping perfectly
still for a full hour before he dared venture
forth again for the coffee-pot, which he was
obliged to leave behind.</p>
<p>The vigilance of their father in the defence of
the cabin not only kept the children in the tree
longer than Charlie bargained for when he turned
in, on that memorable afternoon, to play Crusoe,
but also put their lives in jeopardy from their
father&#8217;s bullets. For, as we have said before, the
tree being a large one, and conveniently near the
cabin, the savages would creep up behind it to
shoot from, which would be sure to bring a dangerous
response; and Charlie was obliged to know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
more than once that the tree was perforated by
balls from his father&#8217;s rifle. At such times the
youngsters kept as close to the ground as possible.</p>
<p>When the Indians set fire to the roof of the
cabin, Charlie was almost wild with excitement,
fearing that his parents would now be burned to
death. Nor was his anxiety lessened when he
saw his father ascend the roof to extinguish the
flames, thus exposing himself to the deadly aim
of the foe.</p>
<p>Captain Manly&#8217;s attack, however, he did not
understand; for the soldiers did not pass near the
tree, and the confusion and clamor, the horrid
yells that rent the air, and the tramp of the contending
parties in the dim twilight, seemed like
the chaos of a whirlwind,&ndash;the fight was so sudden
and so soon over,&ndash;and he dared not leave the
tree after the battle, not knowing what it all meant.
He had a bewildered idea that there had been an
attack on the Indians by a party of whites, but
which had been victorious he could not tell. So
he watched on, trying to determine this point,
until late in the night, when he saw a dark body
moving cautiously from the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indians have taken the cabin,&#8221; he concluded,
&#8220;and now they&#8217;ll burn our house as they
did the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet it puzzled him to see how closely
together the savages kept, instead of being scattered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
about in all directions, as they were before.
He could see them moving quietly away, and
thought some of them were mounted on their
ponies. After they were well out of sight, resting
Bub&#8217;s head against the skin powder-bag,&ndash;for
the little fellow, overcome by weariness, had
fallen asleep,&ndash;he crawled from his hiding-place
and reconnoitred. Suddenly he stumbled over a
dead Indian, lying with his rifle beside him; and
soon he came across another. But all was still
in the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a battle,&#8221; said Charlie to himself,
exultantly, &#8220;and the Indians are driven
away;&#8221; and he entered the house.</p>
<p>All was dark and quiet; so, feeling his way
to the chimney, he raked open the ashes, and
found a few sparks. Going out, he gathered
twigs and limbs, and, heaping them on the hearth,
blew them into a blaze; then running to the tree,
he awakened Bub, and hurried him to the cabin,
and returned for his Crusoe provisions and ammunition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s father and mother?&#8221; asked Bub,
looking round in dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Charlie, soothingly, with a profound
air, &#8220;that the settlers have got together and
driven off the Indians, and taken our folks where
they&#8217;ll be safe; and now, Bub, we&#8217;ll live here like
Robinson Crusoe on the island, and you shall be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
my Friday till our folks come back; for, you see,
they&#8217;ll find out that we ain&#8217;t with them, and they&#8217;ll
come and take us away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we go where our folks is now?&#8221; inquired
Bub, beginning to cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so dark we can&#8217;t find them,&#8221; said Charlie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t the Indians come and hurt us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie started at the thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he replied, shaking his head
doubtfully; &#8220;&#8217;twould be just like them. But I&#8217;ll
tell you what I&#8217;ll do. There&#8217;s a good many Indians
been killed around the house, and I&#8217;ll just
go out and get all the rifles I can, and then let
them try it if they want to. Why, Robinson
Crusoe drove off twenty-nine canoes full, and I
bet he didn&#8217;t have so many guns as I&#8217;ll have.&#8221;</p>
<p>And hastening out, he kept finding and bringing
them in until he had a dozen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring in lots of wood,
and we&#8217;ll keep the fire crackling;&#8221; and he stirred
the burning limbs to make the sparks fly; &#8220;and
if the Indians return, they&#8217;ll think there&#8217;s a big
houseful of men in here. Besides,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;if our folks see the sparks from the chimney,
they&#8217;ll know you and I are here, and return
for us. And on the whole, I guess I&#8217;d rather go
with them, than to fight the cannibals alone; for
if I should happen to be killed, I suppose they&#8217;d
have to eat me, and I&#8217;d rather not be eaten.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>Charlie brought from the enclosure a fine pile
of wood and a pail of water, then went out to
see that the outer door was secured, and closed
the shutter in the room. He then proceeded to
examine the rifles,&ndash;for he was well versed in
fire-arms, like western boys generally,&ndash;and
carefully cleaned and loaded them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;Crusoe had his seven guns
mounted, and I&#8217;ll mount my twelve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately for his scheme, the places had
been already prepared. After this was done, he
went down into the cellar to see if there was anything
to eat, and finding some food, he returned,
and hanging the tea-kettle over the fire, he poured
some boiling water upon the tea-grounds in the
tea-pot, then set the table for himself and Bub,
and assigning Bub one chair, and getting another
for himself, said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might as well live like folks, as long as
we are out of the tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, having finished their repast, he said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel tired, it&#8217;s so long since I&#8217;ve had a good
sleep; so I guess we&#8217;d better go to bed.&#8221; And
lying down upon the bed in the corner, with an
arm lovingly clasping little Bub, they sank into
the sweet sleep of childhood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>BUB&#8217;S BROADSIDE.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was nine o&#8217;clock next morning when Charlie
awoke, much refreshed. Some moments
elapsed before he could recollect where he was,
and how he came there. Then, hastening, first
to the port-holes, through which his guns were
pointed, he scanned the field on all sides, to see
if any enemy was in view. The result being
satisfactory, he commenced preparations for
breakfast, for Bub was now awake, and hungry
as a &#8220;starved kitten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you what,&#8221; said he to Bub, as they ate
their morning meal, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a jolly plan for us.
I&#8217;m going to dig a cave in the cellar, so that if
the Indians <i>should</i> get into the cabin, we could
hide there just as we did in the tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll have some water in there for me
to drink,&#8221; suggested Bub.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Charlie; &#8220;we&#8217;ll have everything
that we want.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, assuring himself, by another examination,
that matters outside wore a peaceful aspect, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
repaired to the cellar, to commence the excavation.
Luckily for Charlie&#8217;s plan, the cellar
walls had been carelessly constructed, and in a
corner he found a large-sized stone, that he
could remove from its place in the foundation
without disturbing the others. Taking this out,
with the iron fire-shovel, he soon had drawn
forth a large quantity of the loose sand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; observed Charlie to Bub, &#8220;you must
take the shovel, and throw the sand about the
cellar, while I work with my hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was quite an easy task, the sand was so
light and dry. And ere long he had a place
large enough to conceal himself and Bub.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I shall make it extend farther
in, so that if the cabin is burnt over our
heads, it won&#8217;t be too hot for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bub made little headway in shovelling the
sand; so Charlie finished the job for him, and
then from a heap of litter, which he had before
taken the precaution to scrape into a corner, he
took enough to cover the fresh sand all over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;let&#8217;s try our new cave;&#8221;
and, squeezing through the hole from which he
had taken the stone, Bub creeping in after him,
Charlie reached out and drew the stone into its
place again. Charlie was delighted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like this!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;it&#8217;s more like
Robinson Crusoe&#8217;s cave.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>Bub thought he liked it too, but soon cried out,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t hardly breeve; an&#8217; it&#8217;s drefful dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky I&#8217;ve tried it,&#8221; replied Charlie;
&#8220;but I&#8217;ll fix it all nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>And pushing out the stone with his foot, he
went up stairs, and returned with an old bayonet,
with which he succeeded in dexterously working
some small holes through the mortar, with which
the crevices of the ill-matched stones were filled.
This was so ingeniously done, that it would not
be noticed; and yet enough light and air were let
in to make the place tolerable for the purpose for
which it was intended.</p>
<p>It was now past noon, and they went up stairs,
and Charlie looked out again, to see if there
were any signs of danger; but still &#8220;all was
quiet along the Potomac.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; sagely observed Charlie,
&#8220;that the Indians are ever coming back. In my
opinion they have had about enough of fighting,
they cleared off so quick, and there is so many
of them dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>At which Bub waxed valiant, and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had my big stick to stick into their
backs, if they do come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie could not forbear a laugh at this, notwithstanding
the sanguinary scenes that had
crowded the last few days with horrors, but
answered,&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you can do, Bub, to drive them
away, if they should come;&#8221; and, drawing a ball
of twine from his pocket, he tied it to the trigger
of one of the mounted rifles, then feeling again in
his pocket for his knife to cut off the string, he
said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my jackknife? I must have lost it
in going to the spring for water; lots of things
tumbled out as I crawled through the grass.
Never mind; I can use a case-knife;&#8221; and, taking
one from the table, he divided the string so as
to leave the end of it hanging within easy reach
of Bub. He did the same to all the guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he explained to Bub, &#8220;when I tell you
to pull one of these strings, you must do it as quick
as you can. I will whisper, Pull! and you must
take right hold of the twine, and draw it so;&#8221;
and, contrary to Charlie&#8217;s intention, bang went
the rifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I didn&#8217;t mean to do that; but it will
show you how. Pulling the string made the
gun go off, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bub was all attention, and asked, eagerly,</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I do it now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, no,&#8221; replied Charlie. &#8220;I mean, when I
<i>tell</i> you to. When the Indians come, and I say,
<i>Pull!</i> Suppose, for instance, I should get up in
this way,&#8221;&ndash;and he ascended to the lookout,&ndash;&#8220;and
I should look out in this way,&#8221;&ndash;and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
put his eye to the port-hole,&ndash;&#8220;and I should see
a big Indian coming to kill Bub.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the little listener, &#8220;I knows;&#8221;
and his eyes glistened with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as I was saying, I peep out, and I see
a big Indian coming&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bub at this instinctively drew nearer the string,
his gaze on Charlie.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I should whisper, <i>Pull!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly Bub&#8217;s fat fist twitched the string, and
a second report echoed over the prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do that for?&#8221; asked his brother,
much displeased. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t wish you to do it
now. I was only explaining how to do it, and
I want you to do it right. Don&#8217;t touch the strings
till I tell you; and then, when I give the word,
you&#8217;ll pull&ndash;won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly-head looked as if he intended to stand
by the guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that way, Bub,&#8221; continued Charlie, &#8220;we
could keep off a great many Indians; I loading
and firing, and you firing too, Bub. But I
haven&#8217;t put that last rifle in just right;&#8221; and glancing
out of the hole, as he adjusted it, he turned
deathly pale, and his whispered utterance was
strangely faint, as he exclaimed,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there isn&#8217;t an Indian now!&#8221;</p>
<p>It is said by old hunters accustomed to shoot
small game, however skilful in the use of fire-arms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
they may be, that the first time they see a
large animal,&ndash;a deer, for example,&ndash;such a
nervous excitement seizes them, although the
creature stands within a few feet of them, for
an instant they cannot command themselves to
fire; and when they do, they are sure to miss
the object. It is not surprising, then, that Charlie
was, for a moment, paralyzed. He gazed at
the Indian as if fascinated, as the savage glided
along, his head bent, going from the spring towards
the tree, in the very path through which
Charlie had carried the water, stooping to pick
up something, then keeping on a few paces, then
stopping and putting his ear to the ground, as if
intently listening. He was within easy range of
Charlie&#8217;s rifle all the time; yet the boy lifted not
his finger.</p>
<p>The savage now rapidly darted forward, as
if following Charlie&#8217;s trail, and, sweeping the
bushes back with his hand, discovered the opening
in the tree, and, to Charlie&#8217;s amazement, managed
to creep in. Nearly an hour had passed,
and Charlie still waited in painful suspense, wondering
what next would transpire, when he saw
a score or more of Indians stealthily approaching
from different directions towards the cabin. The
blood returned to Charlie&#8217;s face, and, recovering
his senses, he whispered to Bub, &#8220;The Indians
have come.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>He then took sight across the rifle nearest Bub,
and found that it covered several of the savages;
and, taking aim with the one next to it, he said
to his little brother, &#8220;Pull!&#8221; Bub did so, and,
starting on the round trot, pulled each string in
succession. A broadside ensued that would have
done honor to an old-fashioned ship of war. The
effect was prodigious. The savages seemed to
think that a strong force occupied the cabin; for,
with a loud yell, and a hasty discharge of fire-arms,
they vanished from sight.</p>
<p>Charlie was astounded at Bub&#8217;s misunderstanding
of the order and the effect produced. Gazing
amazed into vacancy,&ndash;for the enemy had
disappeared,&ndash;he sprang to the floor, hugged
Bub till he almost suffocated him, and, laughing
uncontrollably, stammered, &#8220;That beats Robinson
Crusoe!&#8221;</p>
<p>The scene was indeed ludicrous. The savages
had come to carry off their dead comrades,
and, creeping cautiously along, had got so near
the house without being observed, that their
suspicion that the cabin was vacated became confirmed.
The discharge of the rifles by the boys
was, therefore, a perfect surprise, the fact that
they were permitted to get so near before they
were fired upon impressing them all the more;
for they well knew that, if few were in the
dwelling to defend it, every effort would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
been put forth to keep them at a distance. Moreover,
the firing coming from all sides of the
dwelling at once, had also the appearance as if
it was quite heavily manned.</p>
<p>It was a brilliant day, and the light puff of
smoke from each rifle rose at once into the air,
giving Charlie a fine view of the field; and the
simultaneous springing up of so many astonished
savages, their queer grimaces, and the grotesque
manner in which they scrambled out of range,
struck the lad as irresistibly comic, especially as
he considered that it was Bub&#8217;s blunder that was
at the bottom of the rout.</p>
<p>Recovering himself, he proceeded to reload the
rifles. But one thing gave him uneasiness. The
Indian, he was quite sure, was still in the tree.
What was he there for? &#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; thought
Charlie, &#8220;he will make a hole through the tree,
and watch his chance, and shoot me. At any
rate, he&#8217;s a spy; and if he should find out that
only Bub and I were here, he might make us
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was puzzled to know what to do. He set
himself to watch through the port-hole to see if
he would come out. Two long hours Charlie
remained at his post, till he grew weary with the
duty. Then he bethought himself of another
plan. He had read in the old spelling book of
the boy who wouldn&#8217;t descend from the farmer&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
apple tree for coaxing; and the farmer said, &#8220;If
you will not come down for words, I&#8217;ll try the
effect of stones,&#8221; which brought the trespasser
quickly to the ground. Now, the Indian was not
<i>up</i> a tree, but he was <i>in</i> one, and he would not
come out for Charlie&#8217;s watching; so Charlie
thought he would employ harder arguments,
and, aiming at the point where he supposed the
savage must be in his hiding-place, he blazed
away. He had fired three times, when, suddenly,
the tawny occupant slipped out, and
crouched behind the tree, from which he commenced
making friendly signs towards the corner
of the cabin from which the bullets came.
Charlie understood the signals, but muttering,
&#8220;You can&#8217;t catch me that way, old villain,&#8221;
continued firing every time he thought he could
hit the savage. The Indian had not, during all
this, fired in return. This seemed curious to the
boy; but concluding it to be an Indian trick, he
determined not to be outwitted. Whatever the
object of the savage was in his mysterious conduct,
he at last despaired of accomplishing it,
and adroitly slipped away.</p>
<p>As night drew its heavy curtains around the
beleaguered cabin, Charlie experienced a feeling
of dread creeping over him. He felt comparatively
safe while he could see the foe; but now
the night seemed ominous of evil. The wind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
moaning through the trees, the ticking of the
insect under the bark in the logs, and even the
shrill chirping of the cricket, sounded unnatural
to him. He thought of the dead and gory forms
stretched upon the greensward without; the grass
matted with human blood; the imprecations and
fierce shouts that had resounded, and the deathly
struggles that passed before him while sheltered
by the friendly tree; the heavy tramp of
men fighting in the deadly struggle; the sharp
reports of the fire-arms; the horrible screams and
heart-piercing pleadings of women and children
as they were murdered and tortured by the savages;
the lurid glare of the burning cabins; the
Indians dancing and yelling in horrid mirth:
his active brain was filled with such remembrances.
In the stillness and loneliness of night,
in that cabin, these awful scenes came up with
appalling vividness, and weird and demon faces
seemed to peep and mutter at him from the corners
of the room. Once he fancied that he heard
the cellar stairs creak under a heavy tread.
And while Bub slept peacefully in childish unconsciousness
of his brother&#8217;s terror, he shivered
and watched through that long night until the
rosy beams of morning dispelled the illusions of
the darkness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>LONG HAIR.</h3>
</div>
<p>The news of Mr. Jones&#8217;s death, together with
the atrocities connected with the Indian uprising,
spread a gloom throughout the fort; and when,
two days later, the funeral of the pioneer took
place, tears were in many a veteran&#8217;s eye. General
McElroy respected the qualities which had
marked the last days of the deceased, and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not serve in the ranks, but if ever a
man deserved a soldier&#8217;s burial, poor Jones does;
and he shall have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the body was borne to the grave under
military escort, the soldiers marching to the
mournful strains of the funeral dirge and muffled
drums; the corpse was lowered to its last resting-place;
the burial service read with a trembling
voice by the chaplain,&ndash;for the missionary had
taken his place among the mourners by the side
of the widow,&ndash;the usual salute was fired, and
the procession retraced its steps.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones felt that she was now bereaved
indeed, and almost alone in the world, and it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
became a question with her what she could do,
under the circumstances, for herself and family.
Disconsolately she discussed this matter with
Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot remain longer in these apartments,
living on the hospitality of the general,&#8221; said
she; &#8220;and as your dear father is gone, it becomes
me to earn something for my own support. I
must have Robert with me, he is so young, and
make some humble home where you can be with
us as much as possible. But what I can do to
effect this I cannot now see, there are so few
opportunities for women to earn.&#8221;</p>
<p>It goaded Tom that his mother was under the
necessity of talking in so depressed a way, and
that he could do nothing suitably to provide for
her. At this juncture there was a gentle knock
at the door, and Mrs. McElroy entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will excuse me if I have intruded,&#8221; said
she; &#8220;but I came in to ask what arrangements,
if any, you had made for the future, and to say
that, if you have nothing better in view, the general
and myself would like to have you remain
with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have already been dependent on your
hospitality too long,&#8221; objected Mrs. Jones, &#8220;and
it seems proper that I should make a home for
myself and Robert as soon as possible.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any suitable place provided as
yet?&#8221; asked Mrs. McElroy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not decisively,&#8221; answered the widow.</p>
<p>&#8220;It could not be expected that you would so
soon,&#8221; answered Mrs. McElroy. &#8220;Now we have
a plan for you, which may be to our mutual advantage.
The little community dwelling within
these brick walls is a very social one, and the
general&#8217;s time and my own is so much occupied,
that my children suffer for a mother&#8217;s care. You
are exactly the person we need to take the oversight
of them. Your own children are a credit
to you; they show that you have just the qualities
of mind and heart for such a position. Now,
if you will look a little after my children&#8217;s training,
you will take a burden from my hands, and
a load of anxiety from my mind, and between us
both, I think we can manage so as not to be overcharged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Robert&ndash;&#8221; began Mrs. Jones, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The general has taken a great fancy to him,
and says if he can have him he will make something
of him; and what my husband undertakes
he never does by halves. Robert would have
the best of advantages, and be under your own
eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones&#8217;s emotions were too great for words.
This unexpected provision for herself and boy
seemed truly providential. She might go the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
world over and not meet with such delicate and
appreciative treatment. Still she hesitated. Her
life in the squatter&#8217;s cabin through so many years
of deprivation and poverty placed her, in her own
consciousness, in such painful contrast to the
courtly and elegant Mrs. McElroy, that she felt
diffident about accepting so responsible a trust.
And she understood children well enough to
know that the offspring of the rich often look
down on those in humbler circumstances. Would
the general&#8217;s children respect her as they should,
in order for her to assume such a relation towards
them as their mother wished? These thoughts
passed rapidly through her mind, and, in justice
to them as well as herself, she felt that she would
like to have that point put to rest. She was a
woman of straightforward good sense, and therefore
decided to be frank in the matter, and
asked,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;But would the arrangement be agreeable to
your children, madam?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. McElroy had foreseen this, and was prepared
with an answer. She rang the bell, and
black Nancy appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Send Alice and Willie here,&#8221; she said; and
in a moment the brother and sister came running
in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Children,&#8221; said their mother, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
to persuade Mrs. Jones to stay with us, and take
charge of you. How would you like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, that would be so nice!&#8221; said Alice, crossing
to Mrs. Jones, and putting her arms around her
neck&ndash;an action that was peculiar to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be real good in her, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221;
chimed in Willie; &#8220;and then I could have Robert
to play with me,&ndash;he makes splendid popguns,&ndash;couldn&#8217;t
I, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>So it was settled, and in such a manner that
Mrs. Jones was made to feel that she was conferring
a favor, rather than having one conferred on
her; and, in fact, the arrangement was mutually
advantageous, as Mrs. McElroy had sincerely
remarked.</p>
<p>Mr. Payson now called to take leave of the
widow, and ask if Tom would like to return
with him. He was much pleased with the arrangement,
expressing anew his sympathy with
her in her bereavements, and, charging her to
cling to the consolation of the gospel, he and
Tom took their departure, the latter tenderly kissing
his mother and Robert as he bade them
good by.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must come often and see your mother,&#8221;
said Mrs. McElroy, cordially; &#8220;you know we
shall be like one family hereafter; and not only
Robert and your mother will be lonesome without
you, but the rest of the children will be glad to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
have you join them in their amusements and
studies,&#8221; to which assurance Alice and Willie
looked their approval. As the wheels of the
missionary&#8217;s buggy rumbled out of the square,
Mrs. Jones said with a sigh,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a change has come over my flock within
a few days! my husband, and Sarah, and dear
little Bub murdered by the Indians, and Charlie,
also, I suppose I must say, although there is
something peculiarly trying in the mystery that
hangs over his fate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not really know, then, what became of
him,&#8221; observed Mrs. McElroy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; and this uncertainty is agonizing. Perhaps
he was captured by the Indians, and may
be at this very moment suffering the most barbarous
treatment from them; or the dear boy may
have been devoured by a wild beast, or he may
be starving in the wilderness. This suspense
concerning him is too much to bear;&#8221; and she
looked anxiously out of the window.</p>
<p>But the hour for dinner had arrived, and Mrs.
Jones and Robert went down with the others to
dine. As they entered the dining-room, the general
directed their attention to the corner of the
room; and there, wrapped in his blanket, sat an
Indian, whom Mrs. Jones, after the first start of
surprise, recognized as Long Hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Jones,&#8221; said the general, &#8220;perhaps you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
can find out what the red-skin wants. He isn&#8217;t
very communicative with me, but seems anxious
to see your Tom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to meet you,&#8221; said Mrs. Jones,
kindly, to the savage. &#8220;Have you anything of
importance to communicate?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Long Hair appeared as if something had
gone wrong with him, and sat in moody silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you not speak to me, Long Hair?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Jones. &#8220;You know I&#8217;ve always
treated you well&ndash;have I not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;White squaw good to Injin. Sojer say Injin
lie; sojer call Long Hair dog; tell him go
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of your men have ill-treated Long
Hair, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said Mrs. Jones to the general.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the general, &#8220;I&#8217;ll see that they
don&#8217;t do it any more;&#8221; and, wishing to propitiate
the tawny brave, he added, &#8220;perhaps Long Hair
would take some dinner with us.&#8221; But the Indian
wasn&#8217;t so easily appeased, and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Long Hair no beggar-dog; Long Hair shoot
deer, shoot raccoon, catch fish, plenty!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; interposed Mrs. Jones, &#8220;didn&#8217;t you
bring some venison to my cabin one day, and did
I refuse it, Long Hair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;White squaw good,&#8221; he repeated; &#8220;Long
Hair never forget. Long Hair sick; white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
squaw medicine him. Long Hair kill deer for
white squaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Jones; &#8220;you were sick, and
I took care of you, as I ought to; and you have
been very kind to me and mine, and I shall never
forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under her gentle influence, the Indian was
persuaded to partake of the food placed before
him. He ate with a voracity which showed that
he had been long fasting, and his appearance
indicated that he had seen hardship and danger.
Mrs. Jones was satisfied that his coming portended
something to her, either good or evil;
and, from his reserve, she feared it might be the
latter, and the better to draw out of him the tidings,
whatever they might be, related the circumstances
attending her husband&#8217;s death, referring
to the murder of Sarah and little Bub, and the
disappearance of Charlie, adding, that she supposed
he was also killed. The Indian listened
in silence till she spoke of Charlie and little Bub,
and then, with energy, exclaimed,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlie no dead! Bub no dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Bub must be dead,&#8221; said Mrs. Jones;
&#8220;for I saw him shot by Yellow Bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Injin speak truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221; asked she,
astonished.</p>
<p>Long Hair made no reply; but drawing from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
beneath his blanket a little shoe, he placed it on
the edge of the table; then, by its side, he laid
an old battered jackknife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Long Hair!&#8221; cried Mrs. Jones, deeply
agitated; &#8220;that&#8217;s Bub&#8217;s shoe, and Charlie&#8217;s knife.
Where did you get them?&#8221; a ray of hope springing
up in her heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Long Hair went find Charlie; travel much;
peep in wigwam much; no find. Long Hair
say Charlie no killed; Charlie no taken prisoner;
Charlie hid near cabin. Long Hair look all
&#8217;bout near cabin; see Charlie hand put down so,&#8221;
spreading his fingers, &#8220;in mud at spring; den
Long Hair say, Charlie thirsty; been spring for
water; find trail; find knife in trail, near big
tree; find shoe near big tree; Bub hid in tree;
then Long Hair push bush way; see hole in
tree. Long Hair hear Injins coming; Long
Hair crawl in tree quick; no Charlie there; no
Bub there; find these in tree;&#8221; taking from his
blanket a handful of nuts, and some potatoes,
and a crust of bread, and some trinkets that must
have fallen from Charlie&#8217;s pocket; &#8220;den Long
Hair see Injins come, one, two, tree, ten, twenty,
many; come all round, crawling, crawling; get
near cabin; Injin think nobody in cabin, &#8217;cause
get near; rifle shoot from cabin, one, two, tree,
many rifle; scare Injin; Injin run like deer;
Long Hair wait to see if Injin come again; no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
come; shoot from cabin at Long Hair; come out
tree; get behind tree quick; make peace sign at
cabin,&ndash;no bleeve Long Hair; try shoot at
him; Long Hair come way&ndash;come to fort!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s strange,&#8221; said General McElroy;
&#8220;from Long Hair&#8217;s account, there seems to be a
number in the cabin; it must be that all the settlers
were not massacred, and have returned,
and taken possession of the cabin; we must send
a force to their relief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where are Charlie and Bub?&#8221; asked
Mrs. Jones of the Indian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Long Hair don&#8217;t know; think in cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many persons, should you judge from
the firing, were in the cabin?&#8221; inquired the
general.</p>
<p>&#8220;Long Hair don&#8217;t know; no trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does Long Hair mean by that?&#8221; asked
Mrs. McElroy of her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;He means that there is no appearance of any
of the settlers being about the cabin,&#8221; said the
general, &#8220;which makes the matter still more incomprehensible;
for if any of the settlers had
come back, Long Hair would have traced them.
Isn&#8217;t that it, Long Hair?&#8221; The Indian nodded
assent. &#8220;And yet he says that there were many
guns fired,&#8221; continued the general; &#8220;so many
that quite a force of the assailing Indians were
panic-struck, and fled. How was the firing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
done, Long Hair? As if by persons that were
used to handling the rifle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One, two, tree, bery good; hit Injin some;
shoot at Long Hair good; much hard get way;
to the most, much poor&ndash;shoot here, shoot dere,
shoot everywhere!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what makes you think the children are
in the cabin?&#8221; asked Mrs. Jones; for, mother-like,
her thoughts were constantly recurring to
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trail go towards cabin,&#8221; replied the sagacious
red man; &#8220;couldn&#8217;t follow trail; shoot Long Hair
if he follow trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that Long Hair is right,&#8221; said the
general, striking the table with the flat of his hand:
&#8220;your boys were born to be heroes, madam. If
I mistake not, that Charlie and Bub of yours
were the defenders of that cabin against the savages.
And yet,&#8221; he added, doubtfully, &#8220;that is
simply absurd; it&#8217;s beyond the power of two little
boys to perform such a feat; for you recollect,
ladies, that Long Hair said that not only a number
of guns were fired, but at the same time;
and to conclude that two little boys should fire
off a score of guns, more or less, simultaneously,
is to assent to a physical impossibility. The
truth is, the deeper I go into this matter, the
more I&#8217;m puzzled. What is your opinion of it,
Long Hair?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Long Hair no sense; no tell; mind much
dark;&#8221; and the Indian seemed mortified that his
sagacity was for once at fault. &#8220;No white settlers
in cabin; Charlie and Bub in cabin; much
gun fire; hurt two, tree Injin; scare much Injin&ndash;don&#8217;t
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He means that he is certain that no settlers
have returned to the cabin,&#8221; explained Mrs.
Jones, &#8220;but that Charlie and Bub are there;
while as to who shot off so many fire-arms, he is
as much in the dark as ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the general, rising, &#8220;there is one
way to clear up this mystery. I&#8217;ll send a trusty
detachment there at once to open the secrets
of the cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long Hair rose at this, and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;White chief send sojer to cabin, right way,
bimeby, quick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the general, &#8220;and I should like
to have you go with them as guide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered the Indian, sententiously;
&#8220;Long Hair go &#8217;lone; Long Hair always go
&#8217;lone;&#8221; and, starting at a quick pace, he was
speedily out of sight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>&#8220;PULL THE STRING, BUB.&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>The high state of excitement into which
Charlie had been kept by the startling events
connected with the massacre, and his ingenious
defence of the cabin, brought about a reaction;
great lassitude alternated with feverish symptoms.
He felt obliged to watch during the long
hours of night, and caught such snatches of
sleep as Bub&#8217;s performances allowed by day.</p>
<p>One day, after Bub had had his breakfast,
Charlie said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as if I was going to be sick, Bub; my
mouth tastes dreadfully, and my head aches so I
can scarcely see. If I shouldn&#8217;t get well, and
the Indians should come, you must remember and
go into the hole in the cellar, and pull the stone
up in its place after you, just as I showed you
how, and keep still same as we did in the tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And shall I have to take the toffee-pot and
go to the spring, same&#8217;s you did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Charlie; &#8220;the Indians would see
you and kill you if you did, and we have a well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
in the yard. But I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;ll
bring a pail of cold water now, and fill the coffee-pot,
and put it into the hole, and a good lot of
food there for you to eat, so that you wouldn&#8217;t
have to come out for anything; and, Bub, if I
should die, and father and mother should come
and take you away, I want you to tell them
that I put the water and the food there; won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bub; &#8220;and I&#8217;ll let them hide in
our tree; mayn&#8217;t I, Charlie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Charlie; &#8220;you must tell them
all you can remember; tell them that I tried to
be a good boy; tell mother,&#8221;&ndash;speaking very
softly,&ndash;&#8220;that every night we said &#8216;Now I lay
me;&#8217; and don&#8217;t you never forget to say, &#8216;Now I
lay me;&#8217; will you, Bub?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bub; &#8220;tos, if I&#8217;m dood, like
you and mother, and say, &#8216;Now I lay me&#8217; every
night, when I die Dod will send a big angel
down to take me up to heaven; won&#8217;t he,
Charlie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Charlie. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ll go get the
water;&#8221; and, walking with unsteady step to the
well, he returned with a pail of water, and, filling
the coffee-pot, descended, feebly, to the
cellar, and placed it in the hole which he had
dug; then, carrying most of the provisions that
they had, deposited them there also, and going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
up stairs again, he started for the bed, but suddenly
stopped, and putting his hand over his
eyes, said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, where is it? I can&#8217;t see, I&#8217;m so dizzy,&#8221;
and fell by the side of it, on the hard floor. Bub
looked on in wonder, scarcely comprehending
the meaning of it, saying,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the cellar hurt you, Charlie?&#8221; But
there was no answer. In a few moments after,
Charlie opened his eyes, and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bub, I&#8217;m dreadful sick; if the Indians should
come,&ndash;and you must watch for them, Bub, else
they might come when you wasn&#8217;t looking,&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he relapsed into silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you &#8217;peak, Charlie?&#8221; said Bub, wondering
that he did not finish the sentence. The
dear little voice seemed to recall his wandering
thoughts, and, taking up what he was saying
where he had left off, continued,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Indians should come, Bub, remember
and pull the strings; perhaps that will frighten
them off, as it did before. If it doesn&#8217;t, go right
into the hole in the cellar, as I told you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fraid to go into the cellar &#8217;out you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must,&#8221; answered Charlie, &#8220;or the
Indians will kill you. But you won&#8217;t feel afraid
if you pray God to take care of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Dod stronger than dark?&#8221; asked Bub.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Charlie, &#8220;he made the dark; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
made you, and everything; but,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I
feel better; I guess I&#8217;ll get on the bed; it&#8217;s easier
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie was threatened with brain fever, as
his bloodshot eyes, flushed face, and throbbing
temples revealed. The strain had been too great
for him, and he soon seemed to be unconscious
of what was passing around him, and moaned
and tossed incessantly. Chary of his scanty
store of provisions, not knowing how long they
might be shut up in the cabin, he had eaten
sparingly himself, but fed Bub generously, not
only from love to his little brother, but because
it would keep him the more quiet. The night-watching
had worn on him terribly.</p>
<p>Bub had small comprehension of Charlie&#8217;s condition;
and finding, after a while, that Charlie did
not talk with him, he took the post of sentinel,
and did himself great credit. This seemed a
long period to the little fellow, and after going
the rounds of the port-hole, and seeing nothing to
alarm him, he set about amusing himself. The
skin bag, containing the ammunition, caught his
eye; so, getting the fire-shovel, he managed to
dislodge it from the peg on which it hung, and
down it plumped upon the floor. Bub looked
towards Charlie at this, to see what he would
say, but, as he did not seem to notice, lugged the
bag to the hearth, and commenced strewing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
powder upon the fire. This was highly satisfactory,
and one little puff would go up, sending
out the white ashes, to be succeeded by another,
as fast as the fat fist of the little mischief-maker
could work. Then he began to strew the powder
out from the hearth upon the floor; and he clapped
his hands in glee, as he saw the fire run along
the trains that he had laid. Very careless was he
in his pyrotechnic contrivances, and might have
found himself involved in a grand explosion, had
he not bethought himself that, if powder was
good to burn, it was also good to eat. Now, it
chanced that Charlie, in his investigations in the
cupboard, had come across a neglected jug, that
contained molasses; and as molasses was much
prized by Bub, he had kept it for that little boy&#8217;s
sole use, dealing it out to him, a little at a time,
at each meal. So, bringing out the jug and a
saucer, Bub filled the latter with molasses, into
which he stirred the powder, and commenced
eating the sweet mixture. He knew he had been
into mischief that would displease his brother; so,
denying himself the first taste, taking the saucer
and spoon in his hand, he trudged to the bedside,
and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bub made Charlie some tandy. Bub good
boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, as Charlie gave no heed to the peace-offering,
Bub put the saucer upon the table, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
seating himself in his usual place at meal time,
commenced eating. The compound was not so
pleasant as its inventor had expected, and, after
the first few spoonfuls, was abandoned in disgust.
It now occurred to him that it was time
to resume his post as sentry. Mounting to his
first outlook, his little blue eyes dilated, for he
saw an Indian creeping along.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlie,&#8221; said he, jumping down in terror.
&#8220;Injun come to kill Bub!&#8221;</p>
<p>But, as Charlie did not reply, he clambered on
the bed, crying,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlie, &#8217;peak to Bub; Injun come!&#8221; Then,
supposing that the reason he made no answer
was because he had burnt the powder, he said,
with quivering lip,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bub&#8217;s sorry he&#8217;s been naughty; Bub won&#8217;t be
naughty no more. Bub love Charlie;&#8221; and he
put his little face lovingly against Charlie&#8217;s. But
he started back as Charlie&#8217;s hot cheeks touched
his tender flesh. Remembering how hot his own
flesh was when tortured with thirst in the tree,
and how grateful the draught of water was
Charlie fetched from the spring at the risk of his
life, Bub exclaimed,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlie dry; Bub give Charlie some drink!&#8221;
and hastening to the table, he took from it the large
bowl, and filled it from the bucket that Charlie
had left on the floor, and, climbing with it on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
bed again, essaying to put it to his lips, upset
the whole over his face and neck. The sudden
application of the cold water proved a balm to
the sick boy, and, recognizing Bub, he inquired,
confusedly,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&ndash;where am I?&ndash;what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Injun&#8217;s come!&#8221; cried Bub, with renewed
earnestness.</p>
<p>Charlie attempted to rise, but fell back, exhausted,
saying, while a growing faintness crept
over him,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get up, Bub, I&#8217;m so sick; pull the
string.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bub did as he was directed, and again the
cabin fort broke the stillness of prairie and forest
with its unmanned broadside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Charlie, his voice sinking to a
whisper, &#8220;go and hide yourself in the cellar,
Bub, and keep very still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;fraid &#8217;out you!&#8221; said Bub.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so sick,&#8221; answered Charlie, &#8220;I can&#8217;t go
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I so &#8217;fraid!&#8221; quivered Bub, as he saw the
deathly pallor creeping over Charlie&#8217;s face, and
the fixed look of his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray, and then go and keep still,&#8221; said
Charlie.</p>
<p>And little Bub knelt by the bedside, and, folding
his hands, repeated,&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Now I lay me down to sleep;<br />
I pray the Lord my soul to keep;<br />
If I should die before I wake,<br />
I pray the Lord my soul to take;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>and then adding, of his own accord, &#8220;Please,
Dod, take care of Charlie, and don&#8217;t let the dark
hurt Bub;&#8221; rising, he said, &#8220;Bub isn&#8217;t &#8217;fraid
now;&#8221; and, descending into the cellar, he crept
into his hiding-place in the wall, and carefully
readjusted the stone.</p>
<p>The Indian that Bub had seen was Long Hair.
While he was cautiously reconnoitring, the command
under Captain Manly had reached the
ground. The soldiers found the outer door securely
fastened, and, though they thundered for
admittance, there was no response from within.
In their impatience, some broke down the door,
while others scaled the walls. Captain Manly
was the first to enter, and the soldiers pushed in
eagerly after him, anxious to rescue the settlers,
if any were there still. Instantly his eye caught
the figure stretched on the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, boys,&#8221; said he, reverently; &#8220;the little
fellow is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tears filled the eyes of the men as they gathered
about their officer, and gazed silently upon
the features of the boy. A placid look was upon
the brave lad&#8217;s countenance; his curly-brown
hair lay in dank masses, in fine contrast to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
white forehead; while the lessons of self-control,
which he had been taught, made his expression
mature and noble. Captain Manly stooped and
kissed the cold forehead, and the soldiers instinctively
lifted their caps.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the cabin had been carefully
searched.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a soul in it,&#8221; said Sergeant Eaton,
touching his cap. &#8220;The little lad yonder seems
to have been all alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible. What did that firing mean from
the cabin, just as we rode up? And here, you
see, are no less than a dozen rifles, all nicely
mounted. Where are the fingers that pulled the
triggers? Sergeant, there is some mystery here
that needs to be unravelled. Have you searched
the cellar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have, sir,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>The officers stood looking at each other perplexed,
and were continuing their conversation
in a low tone, when Long Hair entered, and
without noticing any one, stood, with folded
arms, gazing at Charlie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Long Hair,&#8221; said the captain, turning abruptly
towards him, &#8220;how long did you get here
before we did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Little time&ndash;not much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you on the ground when we heard the
discharge?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In tree; just here; over dere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did any one leave the cabin after the guns
were fired?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No leave cabin,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you think fired the guns, Long
Hair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlie fire gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Charlie is dead; and the discharge was
only a few moments ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Indian no sense; Charlie no fire gun.
Bub fire gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; returned the captain, impatiently.
&#8220;How could such a child do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What string for, cap&#8217;n?&#8221; asked Long Hair,
pointing to the twine that hung from the gun triggers,
which, being so near the color of the walls,
had been detected only by the Indian&#8217;s keen
glance. This ingenious arrangement was examined
with interest; and the conviction was fast
gaining ground, that Long Hair was not far from
right in his conclusions.</p>
<p>&#8220;But where is the child?&#8221; asked the captain;
and again they searched the cabin. The closet
was peered into to its topmost shelf; a few boxes
that had been left, emptied of their contents;
even the bed on which Charlie lay was minutely
examined, and the improbable supposition that
the walls of the cellar might conceal him was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
renounced, as the soldiers struck the butts of their
guns against the stones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible,&#8221; asked the captain of Long
Hair,&ndash;for he had learned to rely much on his
sagacity,&ndash;&#8220;that Bub could escape from the
house?&#8221;</p>
<p>Long Hair shook his head, saying,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;No trail; Bub no go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May it plase your honor,&#8221; said the Irish private,
O&#8217;Connor, touching his cap to the captain,
&#8220;I belave, on me sowl, that it&#8217;s the ghost of the
brave lad that shot the guns. The likes of him,
sir, would be afther defendin&#8217; the cabin if &#8217;twas
only out of respect to the onburied bodies of the
women and the childers that has been murthured
by the hathen savages&ndash;bad luck to &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Long Hair,&#8221; said the captain, smiling at the
superstition of the warm-hearted Hibernian, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
a mind, while the men are taking their rations on
the grass, to leave you to clear up this mystery;
I believe, if any one can find it out, you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men, having fallen into line, stacked their
guns, and Long Hair was left alone with Charlie.
He stood for a moment looking at the quiet
form of the boy; and the workings of his usually
stolid face showed the affection which he
felt for him. He then carefully looked about the
room, then went quietly out, and passed around
the cabin, critically examining the ground as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
walked. He soon returned, and made directly
for the cellar, gliding noiselessly in his moccasins
down the stairs. In the dim light he carefully
went over the cellar bottom. Taking up
some of the litter with which it was covered, he
gently scraped the fresh sand away until he came
to litter again. Patiently and carefully then he
removed the top litter from a wide space, noticing
from which direction the sand had been thrown,
and in a moment he was standing where the
heap had been, which Charlie and Bub had
shovelled away. Stooping down now, he saw
where the earth had been fretted by the stone as
it had been pulled out and in; then he placed his
ear to the ground, and listened intently; instantly
he glided from the cellar, and stood with
folded arms before Captain Manly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what luck?&#8221; asked the captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Long Hair find pappoose.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a general excitement at this, and a
number arose, as if eager to follow the captain
and the Indian; but Long Hair stirred not, saying,
angrily,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much sojer; scare pappoose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is sensible,&#8221; said the captain; &#8220;you and
I will go alone, Long Hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian led him at once to the place in the
wall where Bub was concealed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pappoose in dere,&#8221; said the Indian, pointing
to the stone. &#8220;Take stone out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain drew it forth, got down on his
hands and knees, and peeped in, and saw Bub&#8217;s
bright eyes looking into his; and, taking hold
of Bub&#8217;s chubby hand, he said, soothingly,&ndash;for
Bub now began to cry,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, my little fellow; we are all
your friends, and have come to take you to your
mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t Injun kill me?&#8221; asked Bub, glancing
apprehensively at Long Hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the officer; &#8220;it&#8217;s Long Hair; he
came to keep the bad Indians from killing you.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Captain Manly appeared with Bub in
his arms, the air was rent with the joyful shouts
of the soldiers; and Bub suddenly found himself
a hero, as he was borne about and caressed by
them&ndash;a joy that was suddenly intensified to a
wild pitch of excitement, as word was brought
that dear, brave, romantic Charlie had revived.
He was not dead. Aroused by the shouts of the
soldiers over Bub&#8217;s appearance, he had opened
his eyes, and, imagining that the Indians were
assailing the cabin, murmured, in a clear, distinct
voice,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull the string, Bub!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>TOM AND THE MONEY-LENDER.</h3>
</div>
<p>Mr. Cowles&ndash;farmer, grocer, postmaster,
and money-lender&ndash;drew his chair to the fire.
The large, old-fashioned stove had an open front,
and it was pleasant, on such a piercing day, to
see the flames leap, and hear the wood crackle,
and sit in the genial warmth.</p>
<p>The table was neatly set for supper. There
was a platter of cold prairie chicken, a glass dish
containing wild-plum sauce, and a plate of biscuit;
while on the stove hearth stood a white
tureen, holding a few slices of hot toast.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cowles, having been informed by her liege
lord that her presence was not desired at that
particular hour, had gladly improved the opportunity
to take a cup of tea with her friend Mrs.
Barker, and learn the particulars concerning the
accident that happened to Bill Walker and Maria
Hobbs the night before, who, while returning
from a log-house dance, six miles away, were
upset from the wagon into Slough Creek. Mrs.
Cowles dearly loved a dish of gossip, which,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
smoking hot and seasoned to one&#8217;s taste, was
always to be had at Mrs. Barker&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The Cowles were a money-loving and money-getting
race, from the least of them to the greatest;
and Mr. Charles Cowles was not a whit
behind the shrewdest of them in this respect.</p>
<p>It was a stormy afternoon in March, and the
winds, which, like troops of wild horses, came
careering across the prairies, and charged upon
the money-lender&#8217;s &#8220;framed&#8221; house, furiously
whirled the snow, and made shrill, wintry music.
Mr. Cowles added more fuel to the fire, reseated
himself, put his feet into a chair, and fell into a
deep study.</p>
<p>He was the moneyed man of the place, and,
although comparatively a new comer, was the
autocrat of the settlement. His first visit to the
town, &#8220;prospecting,&#8221; caused considerable commotion;
for if the groves and prairies had been
arranged on the plan of a vast whispering-gallery,
the fact that he had a golden purse could scarcely
have circulated more rapidly. Many prophesied
he would not condescend to dwell in so small a
town&ndash;a surmise that seemed the more probable
from his haughty, overbearing carriage. And
when it was certain that he had bought out the
best of the two stores, and carpenters were set to
work building a large addition to the grocery,
and teams arrived from the Mississippi loaded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
with barrels and boxes of goods, there was general
congratulation. The town will go ahead
now, the settlers said; men of capital are beginning
to come in, and land is sure to rise.</p>
<p>But Mr. Cowles did not pitch his tent there for
the benefit of the public, as the public soon had
reason to know. He invested nothing in &#8220;improvements,&#8221;
but simply kept his stock replenished,
selling at the high frontier prices, giving
credit when wanted, but always taking ample
security, and letting money in the same way, at
five per cent. per month.</p>
<p>The settlers had met with the usual financial
disappointments of the frontier, and then a business
revulsion at the east caused a fall in the
value of land, and a diminution of immigration;
and, having expended the little they had on their
arrival, they were compelled to do as best they
could. In this extremity it became common for
them to get trusted at the store for groceries, and
hire money of its proprietor; and in an astonishingly
short space of time, the sharp grocer held
mortgages on most of the farms in the neighborhood.
He was inexorable when pay-day came;
and if the money was not ready, he foreclosed,
deaf to all appeals. But of this he invariably
gave each one who applied for a loan an offensively
plain warning. He was a middle-sized,
broad-chested, black-eyed man, muscular, passionate,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
blasphemously profane, heavy-voiced,
had a remarkable command of language, and
when angered his eyes seemed to shoot lightning,
and he would gesticulate with great energy.
There was no respect of persons or station with
him; high and low were served alike. When
credit or money was asked for, he would say,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, sir; but, mind you,&#8221; with a fearful
oath, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t pay according to agreement,
I shan&#8217;t wait a moment. Everybody that deals
with me has to be on the square. O, yes; you
<i>expect</i> to pay, but you won&#8217;t. And don&#8217;t you
come whining and crying round me then; it won&#8217;t
make any sort of difference. I&#8217;ve put my grip on
your land, and I tell you now that I shan&#8217;t let go.
Don&#8217;t you say, then, that I didn&#8217;t tell you beforehand
just how it would turn out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The money-lender of the young village was
feared, hated, and fawned upon. His bearing
was imperious and sneering towards all. He had
a vigorous intellect, however, was uncommonly
well-informed, and would discourse to the groups
in his store, sitting with his stout legs hanging
over the counter, with a coarse brilliancy, original
and sagacious, from which the more cultured
might cull gems of thought, fresh and striking,
despite the terrible swearing, which would startle
even bad men.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>Was there &#8220;a well in the rock&#8221; of this man&#8217;s
hard heart? We shall see.</p>
<p>The lines of the money-lender&#8217;s face were
bitterly hard; but on this afternoon his features
worked as if strong conflicting emotions were
striving for mastery. Something unusual was
stirring his brain; he sat thinking, thinking, uneasily
shifting his position, and at length arose,
and passing through a dark hall, entered the
shop, and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Tom, is that you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the young man, diffidently;
&#8220;Mr. Payson said you wished to see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, walk in this way;&#8221; and Mr. Cowles
returned to the home-room, followed by Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know why I sent for you?&#8221; asked
the grocer.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I had a little private matter that I
wished to talk with you about; but I&#8217;m hungry
as a bear, and if you&#8217;ll do me the favor to drink
a cup of tea with me, I&#8217;ll try to explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom had ever shrunk from contact with this
man, and marvelled much at finding himself his
guest. Yet a cosy sitting down together they
had, Tom&#8217;s host being singularly attentive to
him, while they partook of the nice edibles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; said the grocer, as they sat back from
the table, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard good accounts of you;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
and his voice grew soft and tremulous; &#8220;and
I&#8217;m really glad of it. And I&#8217;ve had an eye on
you myself quite a while; and, bad as they say
old Cowles is, I like to see others do well. You
stuck by your folks when you wished to go off;
that&#8217;s right. You made the most of your schooling;
that&#8217;s in your favor. You are an honest,
right-minded lad, aiming to be, I suspect, some
such a man as that missionary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s surprise grew apace. How did this
rough, swearing, covetous dealer ferret out his
heart&#8217;s secrets?</p>
<p>&#8220;You wished to go from home to study, but,
like a true son, staid by to help the family.
That must have been a great self-denial to you;
was it not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; faltered Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it was. But how did you manage
to give it up so bravely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother advised me to pray about it, and
I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it does any good to pray?&#8221;
asked the grocer.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, yes, indeed. I couldn&#8217;t live without
prayer, it helps me so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; objected his questioner, &#8220;do you imagine
that the great God cares enough about our little
affairs to answer the trifling requests we may
make of him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do, sir,&#8221; replied Tom, with glowing cheeks
and tearful eyes; &#8220;I have known him to do so
many and many a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you were deceived.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O,&#8221; cried Tom, &#8220;if you had been in the missionary&#8217;s
family as much as I have, and heard
him pray for things, and then see just what he
asked for come into the house almost before he
arose from his knees, you could not doubt that
God had heard him. Why, sir, how do you
suppose he has managed to get along on the
little that the settlers have paid him, unless it has
been in answer to prayer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure he must have been pinched,&#8221; answered
the money-lender, moving uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to relate an instance or two,&#8221;
continued Tom, &#8220;if it would not be&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, it won&#8217;t be disagreeable to me; but I
have not time to hear it now. I believe all you
say. I tell you what it is, young man,&#8221; he added,
rising and pacing the floor, deeply agitated, &#8220;I
know more about these matters than folks think.
There&#8217;s my brother; he&#8217;s a Methodist minister,
just like this missionary about praying. He&#8217;s
often prayed for me, and says he has the evidence
that I shall be converted, and become a
preacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you will,&#8221; earnestly remarked Tom;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
&#8220;you have ability enough to do a great deal of
good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So he says. What if it should come about!
How strange it would seem for a cursing old
sinner like me to preach and pray as that missionary
does! They call me a <i>hard</i> man. But
what can I do? Don&#8217;t I inform every soul that
asks me for money that he&#8217;s a fool, and that I
shall hold him to the writing? I get their lands,
it is true; but if I did not, somebody else would.
Why, they mortgage all they have, and then buy
the highest priced goods in the store. I&#8217;ve no
patience with such folks, and they don&#8217;t get much
mercy from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; bluntly said Tom, &#8220;I can&#8217;t see how
another&#8217;s wrong-doing justifies ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; he returned, gloomily. &#8220;But
I&#8217;ve a different sort of business to transact with
you, than to defend my misdeeds. That missionary
has been making me a pastoral visit, and
he took it upon himself to inform me that the Lord
has called you to preach the gospel, and that it
is my duty to furnish money to send you off to
college, or some such place, where they grind
out ministers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me!&#8221; exclaimed Tom, rising to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you; sit down, sit down, young man,
and be calm;&#8221; and the grocer, in his own excitement,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
gesticulated violently with both arms
at once. &#8220;He says that I&#8217;m the only man here
that has the money to do this. Pretty cool&ndash;isn&#8217;t
it?&ndash;to dictate to old Cowles, the miserly
money-grabber, in that way. I just turned on
my heel, and left him in the middle of his ordering;
but, you see, I couldn&#8217;t help thinking about
it night and day. I wouldn&#8217;t wonder if that meddling
missionary had been praying about it all the
while; and the result is, the old money-lender is
going to give you a lift, my boy. We, hackneyed,
hopeless old reprobates, need just such preachers
as the missionary&#8217;s famous seminary is going to
make out of you; and I invited you here to say
that you can depend on me for two hundred dollars
in gold to start with, and as much more each
year, till you graduate, as the missionary says you
need. When old Cowles begins to do a thing,
mind you, he never does it by halves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Tom, choking with joy and wonder,
&#8220;how shall I pay you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pay! pay!&#8221; roared the grocer, his eyes
shooting flame; then, suddenly waxing tender,
the tears extinguishing the fire-flashes, &#8220;if you
will pray for a poor old rebel like me, it is all the
pay I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, going into the entry, he called,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnson! Johnson!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here, sir,&#8221; said a voice; and the dapper little
tailor, who rented a window in the store, made
his appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Measure this young man for a suit of clothes,&#8221;
said the grocer; &#8220;and mind and give him a
genteel fit, that will do for him in the best
circles east.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the clear, honest voice of Deacon Palmer
that fell on Tom&#8217;s ear, and which he now
heard for the hundredth time. Year in and out,
at morning and night, the good man had sung
this, his favorite song,&ndash;bachelor though he was,
with silver-streaked hair,&ndash;as if his heart yearned
for the wifely waiting, and the sweet home-joys
it pictured. Why were they not his? Do all have
their longings for something brighter and better
than the present brings? something for which they
must wait and wait, and perchance never attain?</p>
<p>Tom knocked modestly at the storekeeper&#8217;s
door. A moment, and the money-lender opened
it, saying, heartily,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Walk in; walk in!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I thank you,&#8221; answered Tom; &#8220;I called
to say, that as I am to start on Monday to begin
study at the east,&#8221;&ndash;and the young man&#8217;s tones
grew tremulous,&ndash;&#8220;General and Mrs. McElroy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
and mother are to be at the missionary&#8217;s to-day,
and they desire the pleasure of your company at
dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, young man, you <i>have</i> brought a
message&ndash;haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; exclaimed the grocer,
fidgeting about. &#8220;A pretty mixed-up company
that would be&ndash;wouldn&#8217;t it? Old Cowles sitting
down to table with a minister of the gospel, and
a student for that sacred calling, and such like
folks. No, no; that wouldn&#8217;t be consistent. Tell
them that I am much obliged, but&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Cowles,&#8221; exclaimed Tom, seizing
his hand, &#8220;you must come. I shall feel dreadfully
hurt if you refuse,&ndash;and they all want you
to so much. And, you know that if it was not
for your kindness&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, boy,&#8221; interrupted the storekeeper,
his black eyes flashing through tears,
&#8220;don&#8217;t talk in that way. All is, if it will please
you, I&#8217;ll come. But how do you go to the river,
Monday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, the missionary is to get a team.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, just say to him that my horses are at
his service.&#8221;</p>
<p>We will not dwell upon the dinner in the log-cabin
parsonage, during which &#8220;irrepressible&#8221;
Bub&ndash;his clerical tastes sharpened by Tom&#8217;s
example&ndash;took clandestine possession of the
attic study, and, constituting himself preacher,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
audience, and choir, undertook to conduct divine
service. Having given out the first hymn, he
drowned the missionary&#8217;s words, as the latter said
grace, by stoutly singing,&ndash;</p>

An angel with a stand.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Neither may we linger amid the tender, solemn
scenes of the Sabbath following, the last Tom
was to spend in the rude frontier sanctuary.</p>
<p>It was evening of a beautiful day in May, when
the money-lender&#8217;s capacious carriage, drawn by
his trusty grays, deposited its passengers at the
landing, to await the steamer. What a lifetime
of thought and emotion seemed crowded into that
interval of waiting, as Mrs. Jones stood with Tom
clasped closely, whispering words of mingled
foreboding, hope, and caution!</p>
<p>&#8220;To be a <i>good</i> minister of Jesus Christ, how
glorious, how sublime!&#8221; said she. &#8220;There is
nothing I so much desire for you. But you are
going into scenes very different from those in
which you have been reared&ndash;scenes which will
have their peculiar and insidious perils. I foresee
that you will rise to distinction in your studies.
But do not seek high things for yourself. Be not
anxious to become what is called a great preacher,
nor aspire to a &#8216;brilliant settlement.&#8217; Sacrifice
not conscience for place and power and the applause
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
of sect. Keep humble. Keep Christ ever
before you; and may he watch between me and
thee while we are separated from each other;&#8221;
and she kissed him a fond farewell. Tom stepped
aboard the steamer, which rapidly bore him
away, carrying in his heart the images of the
godly missionary, fair-haired Alice, and his
mother&ndash;the little group that stood on the shore
gazing so lovingly after him. The young man
wept freely as they faded from sight. But, happily,
the magical splendor of night on the Mississippi
broke in on the tumult of his feelings.
Hundreds of lights gleamed from the shore in
every direction; from village, and city, and town;
from cottage and homestead; while steamer after
steamer, illuminated within and without, came
sweeping, sounding, thundering on, like some
monster leviathan spouting fire. It was as a
dream of enchantment to him, and soon stirred
his brain wonderfully. With singular vividness
the eventful past of his pioneer life flitted before
his mental vision, and again he experienced
the terrible anxieties and thrills of horror and of
heroic resolve connected with the Indian uprising.
And now his tears flow as he revisits in imagination
the lonely grave of his father on the far-off prairie.
Would the dear ones that survived the fearful
outbreak be long safe? Might they not soon
need his aid once more? And the glowing future
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
for which he had so panted, would it be to him all
he had fancied? Would he pass safely the dangers
his far-seeing mother had sketched? Would
he realize her ideal? And the kind missionary
and the eccentric money-lender, they had high
expectations of what he should become. Would
he disappoint their hopes? Tom, wearied with
thought, sought his state-room, and fell asleep,
dreaming that he was hearing, as on the morning
of his first visit to the fort, the bird-like notes of
the song that then floated through the open window,
and that fairy Alice looked out and said,&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget me, Tom, while you are away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus does divine and human love ever intertwine.
How strange, how unvarying the experience!
Farewell, Tom! Farewell, Charlie!
Good by, Bub! Perhaps we may meet again.</p>
